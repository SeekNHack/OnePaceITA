The bond that joins us will never break

and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,300
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

We are the one! Go ahead!

I'll find One Piece...

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,130
and become the Pirate King!

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,460
Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

I've seen everything that's been in your mind since we first met.

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,290
I've heard that you have a soft spot for women,
but I didn't expect it to be this soft.

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,160
How pathetic.

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,480
Your collar is all wrinkled and your tie is crooked.

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,100
Your shirt is stained with blood.

54
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,610
You look terrible.

55
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,520
{\an8}You're a good-for-nothing man, "Black Foot" Sanji!

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,680
{\an8}Did you really think that a guy like you could win my heart?

I can't believe you were fooled by Sis' beauty, you stupid jerk!

60
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,880
You're lying, Violet-chan...

61
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,800
Hey, quit dreaming! Sis was just acting!

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,580
I-I know you have a beautiful heart...

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,090
Why are you still saying that after getting hurt so badly?

64
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,240
Hey, stand up!

65
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,600
You must have been coaxed into this by some bad guys.

66
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,380
You don't even want to be here.

67
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,690
Violet-chan...

68
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,670
Why don't you quit being so romantic?!

69
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,810
So stupid!

70
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,790
That's terrible! But she's beautiful!

71
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,510
That was a hell of a kick, Sis!

72
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,820
You're trying to hold back your anger
against me while looking for a way to escape.

73
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,110
Did you think you could trick me with your lies?

74
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,560
Lies don't work on me.

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,710
I ate the Glare Fruit and became an insight human.

76
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,000
I can see through anything.

77
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,450
Men are all liars.

78
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,210
I'll let myself see what's in your head full of lies.

79
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,520
Why did Trafalgar Law and Straw Hat become allies?

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,860
What are your goals, both on Green Bit and on Dressrosa?

81
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,760
What's your plan and what are you up to?!

82
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,720
You don't have to tell me.

83
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,900
All the answers are inside your head.

84
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,970
We will catch all of your crewmates.

85
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,010
It's coming! That pose!

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,480
Peeping Mind!

87
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,090
W-W-What's the matter?!

88
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,010
Sis!

89
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,950
H-How perverted!

90
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,420
Perverted?!

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,400
I've never seen such an erotic mind!

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
What?!

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,490
What about your plan?! Your true purpose?!

94
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,680
What are you thinking under these circumstances?!

95
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,560
I'm thinking about you.

96
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,530
The way you looked at me at that moment...

97
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,980
I want you to kill someone!

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,630
I knew you were telling the truth!

99
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,250
It doesn't matter if a million people denounce you...

100
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,940
I'm not going to doubt a woman's tears!

101
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,320
What a stupid thing to say...

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,520
What a dumbass!

103
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,190
Sis, if this pervert is useless to us now, let's kill him and get it over with!

104
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,160
A 77 million bounty!

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,280
A member of the Straw Hat Crew! The head of "Black Foot" Sanji!

106
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,600
Let's collect!

107
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,040
Hierro Lagrima!

108
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,040
{\an8}Iron Tear

109
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,210
Whoa! Sis, what're you doing?!

110
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,380
Eye Whale!

111
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,630
Violet-chan, you really were working for Doflamingo against your will, weren't you?!

112
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,940
Run, Black Foot.

113
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,840
Violet-chan, what about you?!

114
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,610
Forget about me!

115
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,140
Why?!

116
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,550
We know what you people have been doing all along.

117
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,650
I was your enemy but you kept believing in me!

118
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,960
You really are a good-for-nothing man!

119
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,200
Thank you for your concern back there.

120
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,640
It made me so happy!

121
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,910
I don't know the situation, but you don't want to work for Doflamingo, do you?!

122
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,930
You even fought your own men!

123
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,410
Let's escape from this island together on our ship!

124
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,750
Look at me, Black Foot!

125
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,620
From the moment you all arrived here with Caesar,

126
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,370
you were walking into that man's trap!

127
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,190
Trap?

128
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,580
Look inside my head.

129
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,970
What you see is Dressrosa this morning.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,650
Your Majesty!

131
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,830
Don't say you quit!

132
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,350
Doflamingo-sama!

133
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,950
Please explain!

134
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,990
Why did you abdicate from the throne?!

135
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,160
How noisy. Aren't they here yet?

136
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,770
What?!

137
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,350
A warship is arriving at the harbor!

138
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,170
What?!

139
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,110
I've seen that logo before!

140
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,350
Cipher Pol Aegis Zero!

141
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,100
They're the Government officials who work directly under the World Nobles!

142
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,320
Why are they here?

143
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,360
Remain calm, citizens of Dressrosa.

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,440
Regarding the report on Doflamingo's abdication from the throne and the Seven Warlords of the Sea...

145
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,650
that spread all over the world...

146
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,310
It was a mistake. Just a false report.

147
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:06,350
And, the news of this will spread around the world in the extra edition, today at 3 in the afternoon.

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,460
It's going to be a secret until then.

149
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,060
You mustn't tell anybody about it.

150
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:18,320
All citizens should keep living peacefully as if nothing has happened.

151
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,060
What's with this cunning deceit that seems plotted by a fox?! {This one CR has totally ignored and put stupid "What's with this? I'm so confused!". The line i wrote seems better and the most thing, it's far more accurate. The Black Adder line: Is It A Cunning Plan?}

152
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,880
The World Government?!

153
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,210
It's beyond a Warlord's control, isn't it?!

154
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,510
I'm...

155
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,120
scared of Doflamingo so I can't run away, but maybe you people can get away in time!

156
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,030
Present time
Green Bit

157
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,830
What should I do?!

158
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,850
Wow! What's this? Nico Robin's upper half popped out!

159
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,600
Nico-ya!

160
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,710
I was listening to the conversation. It was Sanji, wasn't it?

161
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,410
Hey, where are your real body and Nose-ya?

162
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,900
If what Black Foot-ya was talking about is true, the deal with Doflamingo is off.

163
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Huh, off?!

164
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,150
Then, what's gonna happen to my hand-over?!

165
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,280
Nico-ya! Summon Nose-ya!

166
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,380
Let's get off of the island now!

167
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,730
The thing is, we're under Green Bit right now!

168
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,910
Under?!

169
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,070
We had some trouble...

170
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,900
But both Usopp and I are safe.

171
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,960
We can't help you, but if you're gonna escape, go without us.

172
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,370
We'll go to the harbor where we agreed to meet up.

173
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,010
Okay, understo-

174
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,180
T-The Navy!

175
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,790
He's here.

176
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,980
Good luck!

177
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,560
You guys, too!

178
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,740
Joker!

179
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,850
Hey, Law!

180
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,130
You've done well, all things considered!

181
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,290
I didn't expect to see a Navy Admiral here!

182
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,960
Since I'm no longer a Warlord, I'm scared as hell!

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,560
Liar!

184
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,100
At the same time in Dressrosa
"Corrida Colosseum"

185
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,250
Now, all the competitors of
Block C are finally in the arena!

186
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,140
Fighter

187
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,510
Gladiator

188
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,250
139 warriors!

189
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,850
Assassin

190
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,250
Bounty Hunter

191
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,620
Fighter

192
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,720
It's a battle royale!

193
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,980
Boxer

194
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,090
Who's gonna win this?!

195
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,350
Bullfighting

196
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,720
Former Pirate

197
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,090
Giant Warrior

198
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,920
Assassin

199
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,730
Finally!

200
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,000
Now, the battle is...

201
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,690
You're already in the ring? Straw Hat!

202
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,970
You're in Block D, aren't you, Cavendish?!

203
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,350
Are you trying to break in?!

204
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,650
Let go of me!

205
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,810
Cut it out! Or you'll be eliminated!

206
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,490
Let's do it!

207
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,860
Simultaneously
All around the world

208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,480
An extra edition?!

209
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,570
It seems like a correction about something.

210
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,480
What the hell is this?!

211
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,590
The big news about Doflamingo was...

212
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,240
I'm a Candidate for
Warlord of the Sea

213
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,580
Incorrect?!

214
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,850
That's insane!

215
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,390
Green Bit

216
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,600
You used the authority of the World Government.

217
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,700
You fooled the whole world... only to deceive ten of us?!

218
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:25,240
Usually, the more spectacular the magic show, the simpler the trick behind it.

219
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,960
Law.

220
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,680
"There is no way he would do such a ridiculous thing."

221
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,440
People usually have a preconceived idea
or an assumption, which leaves a blind spot.

222
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,830
You're a pirate!

223
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,660
Even if you're a Warlord of the Sea and a king,

224
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,430
you don't have the power to spread a lie all over the world!

225
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:57,700
The only people in this world who have the power to do such a ridiculous thing are...

226
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,030
the Celestial Dragons!

227
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,200
You don't know about Joker's past.

228
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,490
And that will cost you your life!

229
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,060
Don't tell me... you're...

230
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,450
It's bit more complicated.

231
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,330
Law.

232
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,660
Anyway...

233
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,760
I've been wanting to kill you!

234
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,700
Joker! Kick this guy's ass alrea-

235
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,390
There is no way I'm gonna hand him over!

236
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,790
You didn't follow any of my terms!

237
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,950
Doflamingo! This deal is off!

238
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,300
No! W-What're you talking about, you fool?! We got this far!

239
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,280
Is that how you talk to your boss after 10 years of silence?

240
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,100
Leave him, Law.

241
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,120
Caesar is one of my precious subordinates.

242
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,880
Jo...

243
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,550
Issho-san, it's Caesar Clown who is with Law.

244
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,960
I see. He is the scientist from the poison gas incident...

245
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,960
Joker!

246
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,010
But if he is that Warlord's subordinate, he won't be charged.

247
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,930
They'll grant him amnesty.

248
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,730
It's you!

249
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,070
You are Fujitora, appointed as a Navy admiral by the World Military Draft.

250
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,600
I've heard about you.

251
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,460
They say you and Ryokugyu are insanely powerful monsters, with unquestionable power.

252
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,460
{\an8}Ryokugyu: Green Bull

253
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,850
Oh, why thank you.

254
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,040
Don't play dumb.

255
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:53,930
I'm still new to the Navy so it's hard for me to understand what you're doing.

256
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:03,670
I don't have enough evidence yet, but I have received information about you breaking the rules as a Warlord.

257
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,270
The man right there was calling you "Joker"; is that your nickname?

258
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,580
If you want to investigate me, you have to be really determined and collect enough evidence.

259
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,920
Now, what's the Navy's decision about Law's punishment?

260
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,160
Regarding the news about you and the wanted pirates, the Straw Hats,

261
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,590
if you have formed an alliance as reported in the news, you're guilty!

262
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,940
If they have become your subordinates, Law-san, you're...

263
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,940
not guilty!

264
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,900
Our mission depends on your response.

265
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,880
We may have to arrest you and the Straw Hats.

266
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,190
H-Hey, what kind of decision is that?! He can just get away by lying!

267
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,500
Our original plan is ruined.
Now we're being targeted.

268
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,260
Even if I take this matter to Dressrosa,

269
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,470
the situation will only worsen.

270
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,680
I need to buy some time.

271
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,590
The Straw Hats are not working under me! It's an alliance as the article states!

272
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,380
You're such a clumsy man!

273
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,830
Then, we have to strip you of your title.

274
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,610
It'd be if the news ended here, but...

275
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,760
You're kidding me...

276
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,560
A meteorite!?

277
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,360
I-It can't be!

278
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,070
Hey, stop joking around!

279
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,270
Run!

280
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,810
A meteorite is falling on us!

281
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,910
A-Amazing.

282
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,730
W-Where's Issho-san?

283
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,000
What?! What just happened?!

284
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,470
Only the three spots that they're standing on are untouched!

285
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,590
How did the Fleet Admiral train you?! You damn stray dog!

286
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,060
It doesn't matter if he can see or not.

287
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,650
Oh, thank you. I simply wanted to test your skills.

288
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,100
"Dressrosa"
Team Franky

289
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,900
The Flower Field?! Are you gonna go on a picnic?!

290
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,740
Speaking of picnics, where did you wonder off to, Sanji?!

291
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,530
I've been...

292
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,240
in love!

293
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,630
Oh, that's nice to hear. By the way, I think I can find the factory.

294
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,820
Really?!

295
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,120
But unfortunately, we can't just destroy it and get away.

296
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,090
It's gonna be a much bigger task than we expected.

297
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,790
Hey, wait! We don't allow credit!

298
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,300
Somebody, catch that toy!

299
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,610
He ran away without paying!

300
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,410
We don't have time! Doflamingo was...

301
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,350
Yeah, I just read the extra edition. He sure fooled us!

302
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,010
If he gets Caesar back, our entire plan ends in failure!

303
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,120
Let's destroy the factory and put his nose out of joint!

304
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,410
Anyway, come meet us at the Flower Field!

305
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,530
I'm asking you what's with that fairytale-ish place?!

306
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,960
By the way, I can't reach Nami-san!

307
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,040
You still think she's a weakling? She's gonna be fine!

308
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,600
Brook and Monster Chopper are with her!

309
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,530
What is that?

310
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,010
Huh? What's wrong?

311
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,850
Violet-chan, what is that?

312
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,980
That's a broadcast from the Colosseum.

313
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,150
The unknown gladiator, Lucy, is pretty strong!

314
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,550
He's small but tough!

315
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,530
Franky, you won't believe this but, Luffy is...

316
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,960
Yeah, he's fighting in a competition now.

317
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,610
Why did you let him?!
You should've kept an eye on him!

318
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,690
You're in no place to judge me!

319
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,210
Black Foot, I have to go!

320
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,180
My men are coming after me!

321
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,590
You want to go to the secret factory, don't you?

322
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,230
Here is a map.

323
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,120
It's disguised as "Toy House."

324
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,620
But that's the factory.

325
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,480
Hey, I can't take this!
If you help me more, you're gonna...

326
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,870
You're a funny man. It doesn't make any difference.

327
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,470
It seems like the executives already know that I betrayed them.

328
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,340
Violet-chan...

329
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,860
The western harbor! Meet me there!

330
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,190
Hide yourself there and wait until I get there!

331
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,180
That's our rendezvous point!

332
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,920
I will help you get away from here at any price!

333
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,360
You really are a good-for-nothing.

334
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,470
Sorry to interrupt, you good-for-nothing!

335
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,800
You fool! Where did you come from?!

336
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,570
Oh, Violet-chan?!

337
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,930
You have to beat them all up first.

338
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,710
There he is!

339
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,890
A-Amazing!

340
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,130
Why didn't you do it yourself?

341
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:35,230
I couldn't do anything because they're holding Kanjuro as a hostage.

342
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,350
You have to come with me, Sanji-dono! To the place called Toy House!

343
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,850
That's where they are keeping my fellow samurai, Kanjuro!

344
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,720
I don't know where it is, though!

345
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,510
Back on "Green Bit"

346
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,380
Beneath the forest

347
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,280
Tontatta Kingdom

348
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,180
What's causing the ground to shake?

349
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,240
It must be Law and the others.

350
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,160
Damn! I don't wanna die here!

351
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
What?!

352
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,990
The hero is getting upset!

353
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,440
J-Just kidding. The truth is the shake was...

354
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,140
caused by my Haki.

355
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:24,510
Haki?! Isn't that the technique that you used to beat 50,000 villains on Fishman Island?!

356
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,080
As expected from our hero!

357
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,980
Your energy can shake up this kingdom!

358
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,770
Please, please eat this!

359
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,850
It's a Fighting Fish. It's big and a close relative of the goldfish.

360
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,130
A Fighting Fish?!

361
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,620
Yes!

362
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,120
It's good! I didn't expect it to taste this good!

363
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,880
It tastes like the sea monster that I killed.

364
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,630
As I thought,

365
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,410
they're the ones who caught the Fighting Fish.

366
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,180
What kind of strength is that?
The Dwarf tribe is super strong, isn't it?

367
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,080
They're pretty big so they can provide food for the kingdom for months.

368
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,450
Usoland, you're a Big Human so I guess you can eat a lot.

369
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,030
Luffyland who belongs to my fighting force, the Usolanders,

370
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,180
can eat the whole fish with one bite!

371
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,380
What's an Usoland?

372
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,430
Look. Doesn't that look familiar?

373
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,290
He's from the picture book that we read in Jaya.

374
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,050
Is that a statue of Montblanc Noland?!

375
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,960
Yes, it is!

376
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,990
You know him too, don't you?

377
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,660
He was a Big Human botanist who came to visit this kingdom 400 years ago.

378
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,460
At that time, villainous Big Humans were devastating the island.

379
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,700
Seeing that our ancestors were troubled,

380
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,580
he fought alongside us and led them to victory.

381
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,480
He became the legendary hero of the Tontatta Kingdom!

382
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,250
When Usoland said his name and told us that he's one of his descendants,

383
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,980
I was speechless!

384
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,450
L-Look at my head!

385
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,600
This chestnut-shaped head is the proof!

386
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,570
It's true!

387
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,860
The chestnut-shaped head!

388
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,760
I didn't have any idea! I'm so sorry!

389
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,300
You're a horrible person.

390
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,230
You were saved by it too!

391
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,070
Let's eat, get some gifts and go!

392
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,200
This must be destiny.

393
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,440
To see them today.

394
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,130
Indeed!

395
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,980
Today is the day we vowed to fight Doflamingo...

396
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,850
and after 400 years, a legendary hero has came along again!

397
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:55,160
Usoland! After you finish eating, let's go to the Flower Field via the underground passage!

398
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,980
Let's go!

399
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,360
Yeah!

400
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,300
In Dressrosa, where we're gonna fight,

401
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,050
the commander and our fellow soldiers of King Riku's Army are expecting us!

402
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,270
Yeah!

403
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,450
Please stand at the forefront and lead us!

404
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,690
Let's destroy the Donquixote Family!

405
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,550
Yeah!

406
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,270
With Usoland, we're unbeatable!

407
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,550
Yeah!

408
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,450
Our hero!

409
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,220
Usoland!

410
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:37,550
Usoland!
