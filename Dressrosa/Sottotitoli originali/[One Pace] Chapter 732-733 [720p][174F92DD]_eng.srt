and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,020
and go into the enemy trading port!

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,620
Our goal is one little girl.

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,430
Sugar!

52
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,410
She may be small, but she's no pushover!

53
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,540
We will knock Sugar out, and turn all the toys in the country back into humans!

54
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,250
It's so cramped!

55
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,450
Robiland and I will barely be able to fit in there.

56
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,140
Fraland, you'd better take
off your shoulders and arms.

57
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,760
I can't do that!

58
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,900
Hey, that tunnel is way too small for me-land.

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,050
We weren't thinking about big humans using it.

60
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,000
You'll just have to enter through the Toys' House.

61
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,870
The Toys' House lies beneath 
the plateau of the royal palace.

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,070
It's where the toys go every night.

63
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,080
Human entry is forbidden.

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,650
House?  The toys live there?

65
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,590
It's a house in name only.  
There are no beds or anything.

66
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,430
There's just a passage to the underground.

67
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,730
Every night, the toys take that passage...

68
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,040
and work underground all night long.

69
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,100
So the toys out in town are dead tired all the time?

70
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,210
How awful!  That's too awful for words!

71
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,550
A-Anyway...

72
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,180
Fraland can get to the Smile factory that way, right?

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,310
Correct.  The entrances are each of the four cardinal directions.

74
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,560
However, they're all heavily guarded.

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,170
Just how I like it.

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,670
I'll cause a huge ruckus while I'm there!

77
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,620
W-Why would you do that?

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,660
That'll make things easier for you, right?

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,520
You mean...

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,910
While I'm distracting them, you take out Sugar!

81
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,920
Who's that?

82
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,990
Swimming briefs?

83
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,830
What's up with your head?!

84
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,530
Is that a weapon?

85
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,960
Or is he just dumb?

86
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,250
Hey, look at his forked chin!

87
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,960
No doubt about it!
That's Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hat Pirates!

88
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,460
Senor! You shouldn't just shove tomatoes into your mouth.

89
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,540
You'll get your face all messy!

90
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,270
Oh, he's so...

91
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,880
hard-boiled!

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,100

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,250

95
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,120
Oh no, Senor!

96
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,620
Don't be so cold, Senor!

97
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,460
You kids...

98
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,830
are not my type.

99
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,700
Senor!

100
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,720
Don't abandon me, Senor!

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,670
Senor!

102
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,910
Senor!

103
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,310
What's with that pervert?

104
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,070
You're one to talk!

105
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,100
Calling from the Toy House eastern entrance!

106
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,350
One of them's here!

107
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,650
You will let me in.

108
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,620
Weapons Left!

109
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,590
Fire!

110
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,430
One of the Straw Hat Pirates!  It's Cyborg Franky!

111
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,600
Coup de...

112
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,320
Vent!

113
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,680
Would you look at that.

114
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,070
The fools have started rampaging.

115
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,040
It's your job to assist the
World Government's member nations, right?

116
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,530
So they've begun?

117
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,440
The Toys' House is under attack.

118
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,570
Don't worry about it!

119
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,900
The Straw Hats are after the Smile factory.

120
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,090
Even if they make it here...

121
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,730
You can just make them all toys!  Right?

122
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,520
Nobody knows!

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,540
Nobody knows about you!

124
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,900
You're right.

125
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,180
Underground passage

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,420
We've almost reached the trading port.

127
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,960
Captain!  Fraland has started his assault by the Toys' House!

128
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
I see.

129
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,630
I'll cause a huge ruckus while I'm there!

130
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,530
I hope he's alright.

131
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,140
No need to worry!  He's a super-cyborg!

132
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:43,270
I've just received word that four of the
Family's officers are guarding the Toys' House.

133
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,580
O-Officers?

134
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,600
It had to be the Diamante Army, of all people!

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,750
They're martial artists.

136
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,980
They're pretty strong, right?

137
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,100
Their victory rate in the battle tournaments is 100%.

138
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,290
They're the Colosseum's greatest heroes.

139
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,410
100%?

140
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,790
You mean they've never lost?!

141
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,880
Exactly.  So in other words,

142
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,130
Nobody knows the full extent of their power!

143
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,340
H-How big is the enemy's elite force, Leo?

144
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,780
10 officers govern over 2,000 henchmen scattered throughout this land.

145
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,890
In turn, those 10 officers answer to the 3 elite officers.

146
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,940
Each of whom governs their own specialized army.

147
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,560
First is the Trébol Army.

148
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,010
Trébol Army (Special Ability Team)

149
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,880
They're the Special Ability Team.

150
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,250
Sugar!

151
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,450
Sugar

152
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,850
Violet!

153
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,960
Violet

154
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,700
Giolla!

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,490
Giolla

156
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,060
Next is the Diamante Army.

157
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,600
Diamante Army (Battle Brigade)

158
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,390
They're martial artists.

159
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,640
Lao G!

160
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,740
Lao G

161
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,630
Machvise!

162
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,680
Machvise

163
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,580
Senor Pink!

164
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,810
Senor Pink

165
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,000
Dellinger!

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,950
Dellinger

167
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,870
The last one is the Pica Army.

168
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,660
Pica Army (Special Ops Unit)

169
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,800
They're the commando unit!

170
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,580
Gladius!

171
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,760
Gladius

172
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,380
Buffalo and Baby 5!

173
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,730
Buffalo
Baby 5

174
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,480
We've also confirmed two more who aren't in the country right now.

175
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,780
Elite officer Vergo

176
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,780
Elite Officer Vergo.

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,680
And the officer, Monet.

178
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,500
Officer Monet

179
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,090
So we won't have to worry about the martial artists!

180
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,610
Hang in there, Franky!

181
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,010
They're all strong.

182
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,310
You're kidding me!

183
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,220
We're sorry, Usoland!

184
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,550
Thank you.

185
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,870
Don't mention it.

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,530
We're here.  This is the underworld, home to the trading port and the factory.

187
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,870
It's surprisingly noisy.

188
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,670
Are sounds from the surface leaking through?

189
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,710
Hey, who dropped the cargo?!

190
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,640
This toy got caught under it.

191
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,600
I-I'm so sorry!

192
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,250
I'll work harder, so please let me see my family!

193
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,990
Dumbass!  Anyone who can't measure up is headed straight to the scrapyard!

194
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,900
Take him away!

195
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,300
W-Wait!  I can still work!

196
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,350
Help!

197
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,660
Usopp.

198
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,700
Robin, did you... {didn't notice before, but non-canon}

199
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,020
Look.

200
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,440
I can still work! Help!

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,760
If you're gonna be so stingy, I'll cancel our deal!

202
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,440
Bastard, you're exploiting me!

203
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,690
If only you didn't have Joker backing you, I swear...

204
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,600
What is all this?

205
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,650
This is a full-blown harbor town!

206
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,910
Suleiman begins his attack on Rebecca!

207
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,830
Go!

208
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,580
Die, Rebecca!

209
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,340
Suleiman, cut her head off!

210
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,090
Once a hero of the Dias Navy Battle, he is now wanted as a war criminal.

211
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,060
He is a fearful underworld killer!

212
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,920
"Dias Navy Battle" A-rank War Criminal
Suleiman the Beheader

213
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,440
The way he carries himself is like a lifeless ghost.

214
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,130
I did everything for my country.

215
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,720
I loved my homeland.

216
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,850
What about you?

217
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:28,660
It must be difficult to live surrounded by people who despise you.

218
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,430
I don't care how difficult it is.

219
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,430
I don't care who hates me.

220
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,280
I want to live with Soldier-san!

221
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,760
She just won't die!

222
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,180
Including the hateful Rebecca, about 30 people remain in Block D!

223
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,660
Another person is out!

224
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,420
I mean animal!

225
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:01,840
Adventurer, Yonta Maria Great Fleet
Orlumbus

226
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,400
It's killed dozens of people,{Split this line in two to make it easier to read against the caption. -Starfish}

227
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,010
and stained the ring with blood!

228
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,490
The gladiator lion, Agyo, has just...

229
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,570
fallen to Orlumbus' whip.

230
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,250
He's strong.

231
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,570
Admiral!

232
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,810
Pirate, Cavendish

233
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,810
Will one of the favorites win?!

234
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,110
Or will it be a dark horse?!

235
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,110
The Fire Demon
Damask

236
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,920
This is the last battle before the finals!

237
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,920
The Witch Doctor
Mummy

238
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,420
Who is going to take the head of...

239
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,860
King Riku's granddaughter?!

240
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,400
Soldier-san, where are you right now?

241
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,230
Please don't die.

242
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,360
That's all I ask.

243
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,340
Beneath Dressrosa, Underground Trading Port

244
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,590
The soldier's gone?

245
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,820
Isn't he the captain?

246
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:13,000
The captain has the important task of killing Doflamingo the moment Operation SOP succeeds.

247
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,460
He took a few Tontattans and headed to the palace.

248
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,240
Good luck, captain!

249
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,570
Yeah!

250
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,810
We've got the hero Usoland with us.

251
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,370
Usoland, please lead Operation SOP and help us knock Sugar out.

252
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,100
Isn't that the most important job?!

253
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,860
We're here right now.

254
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,110
{\an8}All the bridges are movable.

255
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,640
Lift

256
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,640
Trebol

257
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,640
Sugar

258
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,640
Factory

259
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,640
Underground
Passage

260
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,640
Officers' Tower

261
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,560
And that building in the distance...

262
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,510
that looks like a sea anemone...

263
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,350
That's the Officer's Tower.

264
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,620
That's where Sugar is.

265
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,250
Hey, who's that slacking off over there?!

266
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,080
They've found us! It's over!

267
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,200
What ship are you lot from?!

268
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,100
No, wait, I'm just passing by!

269
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,680
Only the negotiators are allowed off the ships.

270
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,910
Inhel.

271
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,650
Got it.

272
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,620
The fairies are here!

273
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,380
They stripped us of everything!

274
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,400
Tontatta Combat!{Xemnas: Merman Combat anyone?}

275
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,600
Tail Hammer! {Xemnas: Merman Combat anyone?}

276
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,370
T-They're buried in the ground!

277
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,670
Change into these, Usoland, Robiland.

278
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,690
I must say, you're really quick-witted.

279
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,830
Pretending that you were scared to distract the enemy..

280
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,630
Speaking of, do you all have such strength?

281
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,260
Yes, we all can do that much.

282
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,870
But Noland's clan can kill Sea Kings.

283
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,260
We don't even compare.

284
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,200
What kind of monster do these guys think I am?

285
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,940
But I might be able to win without fighting.

286
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,050
Okay everyone, I, Usoland will take command!{Isis: how about" Okay everyone. This Usoland in here, will take command!}

287
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,920
Our opponent is a little girl! {Xemnas: Take this out of context and boy does it sound strange.}

288
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,190
Let's gang up on her and scare her!

289
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,590
Follow me!

290
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,220
Yes, sir!

291
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,510
Oh... No... wait...

292
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,260
Go on ahead!

293
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah!

294
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,170
Let's go to the Officer's Tower!

Lift Junction

311
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,870
Royal Palace, Toys' House, Trading Port,
Officer's Tower, and Lift Junction layout

312
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,190
Hurry and get on!

313
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,080
There's an intruder in the Toys' House!

314
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,040
The Straw Hat Pirates have appeared.

315
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,060
They're fighting Senor Pink-sama at the east entrance.

316
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,890
They're after the factory down here.

317
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,650
Fraland...

318
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,560
I heard you get a bonus for taking them down.

319
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,030
Seriously? How much?!

320
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,630
The reward'll probably be massive.

321
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,090
Let's head up.

322
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,840
Really?

323
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,050
It's a rumor.

324
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,130
Really now, where'd you get that info from?

325
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,870
At this rate, we'll just keep going back and forth between the Toys' House and underground.

326
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,050
Let's take over the lift.

327
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,650
You guys wait here.

328
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,820
Surrender now.

329
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,790
I'm taking over this lift.

330
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,810
This guy is...

331
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,860
The Thunder Soldier from the Colosseum!

332
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,030
How did he get here?

333
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,170
He dodged it!

334
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,120
You're too slow!

335
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,770
Damn you!

336
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,340
You're too slow!

337
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,750
You're too slow!{Isis: a flashback?!}

338
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,440
Soldier-san hit me! That's domestic violence!

339
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,120
No it isn't!

340
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,600
I don't want to hit you!

341
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,320
Then stop before you hit me!

342
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,680
You won't grow without any danger!{Isis: how about "facing any danger"}

343
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,140
Concentrate, Rebecca!

344
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,930
A human's instincts are far greater than you think!

345
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,960
Bring them out!

346
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,270
Believe in the strength of humans!

347
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,310
But you're a toy, Soldier-san!

348
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,640
Stop complaining!

349
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,260
I don't want to learn how to fight anymore!

350
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,160
Why can't you always protect me?

351
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,800
I'm a toy.

352
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,570
If I'm exposed to the rain or wind, I'll rust.

353
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,190
I don't know when my body will reach its limit.

354
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,480
Stand up, Rebecca!

355
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,460
Become strong!

356
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,680
My body isn't made to fight.{Isis: I took the liberty of changing the style of this line and the lines that follows}

357
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,600
Maybe toys are destined...

358
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,630
to break before children become adults.

359
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,120
Forgive me, Rebecca.

360
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,460
Your clumsy father was only able to teach you to fight.

361
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,450
Was he always this strong?!

362
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,110
What are you after?!

363
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,570
What could a toy like you want?!

364
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,040
I want a peaceful country...

365
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,740
where my daughter can be happy! {Saying that he wants a peaceful country where she can live peacefully strikes me as a bit redundant... It's literally "live happily" anyway, so this change was a no-brainer. -Starfish}

366
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,930
I'll have you give Dressrosa back to the Riku Royal Family!

367
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,710
King Riku?

368
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,890
What bullshit are you spouting!?

369
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,390
I'll gladly give my life for that cause.

370
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,450
Corrida Colosseum

371
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,020
What's just happened?!

372
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,130
That was quick.

373
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,480
What the?!

374
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,030
I didn't see a thing.

375
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,950
I'd heard the stories, but...

376
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,160
Oh my, everyone's gone down!

377
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:11,620
All the survivors of Block D have fallen down, and for some reason, none of them are standing up!

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,250
Is this for real?!

379
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,720
The assault on Block D happened in an instant!

380
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,000
No, wait!

381
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,800
Someone's trying to stand up!
