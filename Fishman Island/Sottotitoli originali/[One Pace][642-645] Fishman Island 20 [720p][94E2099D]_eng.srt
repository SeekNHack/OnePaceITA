1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,400
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,950
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,660
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,290
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,460
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,830
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,830
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,440
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,490
We turn the clock back,
to before the Noah began its descent.

10
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,530
We turn the clock back,
to before the Noah began its descent.

11
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,640
We turn the clock back,
to before the Noah began its descent.

12
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,730
Now ah'm mad!

13
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,950
Watch dis!

14
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,270
{\an8}Threat: Mega Monk

15
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,310
He was already ridiculously huge!

16
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,640
Was there a point to that?

17
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,660
How's dat?  Surprised?

18
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,940
Ah'm a tiger blowfish fishman!

19
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,160
Ya scared?

20
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,940
Not really.  Why are you talking so fast?

21
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,070
'Cause if ah don' speak fast, da air'll get out!

22
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,370
The Kraken's way bigger.

23
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,950
What?!  Den how's dis?!

24
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,440
Blowfish!

25
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Watch where your going!

26
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,680
We're gonna be crushed!

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,850
Help!

28
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,710
Wait, Wadatsumi-san!  Please stop!

29
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,720
You're crushing your allies!

30
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,880
You're still not as big as the Kraken.

31
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,480
What?!  Den dis'll do it!

32
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,100
Give us a break!

33
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,770
Your Majesty!

34
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,920
Are you alright?!

35
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,620
Please forgive us!
We weren't able to protect you, Your Highness!

36
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,620
What kind of vassals are we?

37
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,540
Never mind that.  More importantly, did you see the Noah?

38
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,660
Yes.

39
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,760
To think that it would move...

40
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,080
Damn that Decken.
If the Noah collides with the Princess or the island...

41
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,300
it will all be over -jamon!

42
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,250
When we learned what was going on,
we wanted to order the citizens to evacuate...

43
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,410
but all of the island's transmission stations
seem to be occupied by the New Fishman Pirates!

44
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,980
We're also trying to contact
the Border Police outside of the island, but...

45
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,480
Hurry and prepare to fire the bubble!

46
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,020
Quickly!

47
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,400
Why won't they answer?

48
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Anyway, we must get His Majesty to safety!

49
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,420
No.

50
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,480
I will wait for the Princes.

51
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,760
What's going on here?!

52
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,140
Explain what's happening!

53
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,230
Why are there so many pirates?!

54
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,980
Well...

55
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,200
The Straw Hat Pirates...

56
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,670
Jinbe...

57
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,410
Where's the Princess?!

58
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,220
Hody... Decken...

59
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,390
There's no way...

60
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,380
Alright, I understand now.

61
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,390
I understand the situation now!

62
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,100
All troops, head into the plaza!

63
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,580
Support Jinbe and the Straw Hat Pirates!

64
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,590
Aye!

65
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,590
Since they've engaged the strongest enemies,

66
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,600
that leaves the rest of the troops for us!

67
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,240
To think that the crew we tried to imprison for
a crime they didn't commit is protecting our country.

68
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,530
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

69
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,770
The least we can do is show them respect
by supporting them!

70
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,000
Aye!

71
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,870
It's the Neptune Army.

72
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,150
They're no match for us.

73
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,000
Take them down!

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,840
It's time to show them our strength!

75
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,600
Go, slaves!

76
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,450
Now, this way!

77
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,660
Whoa, there!

78
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,060
A useless one!  Just drag him.

79
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,130
Pathetic trash.

80
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,460
How terrible.

81
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Nico Robin.

82
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,150
Can you free the human slaves?

83
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,280
Are you sure?
They may blame Fishman Island for this.

84
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,330
If pirates hold a grudge and attack us,
I'll simply take them out.

85
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,820
But right now...

86
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,900
they aren't even being treated like people.

87
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,540
Hody's men are acting just like the Celestial Dragons.

88
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,570
I can't bear to watch it.

89
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,620
Alright, leave it to me.

90
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you.

91
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,670
My chains... came off!

92
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,250
Hey, what's going on?!

93
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,170
Who did that?!  Who removed the slaves' chains?!

94
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,790
What are you doing, slaves?!

95
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,620
Our chains...

96
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,760
Was that you?

97
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
Why did you save us?

98
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,230
I can't refuse a request from a handsome man.

99
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,510
If you want to thank someone, thank Boss Jinbe.

100
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,770
Jinbe?

101
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,220
Damn you... You shouldn't have done that!

102
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,730
Gotcha!

103
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,950
How'd you get onto my back?!

104
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,450
W-What's this?!

105
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,920
It'll be over soon.  Quiet now.

106
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,130
Let me go!  Who are you?!

107
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,710
Why are there two of you?!

108
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,190
Hammond-san!

109
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,640
Damn that woman!

110
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,410
We owe ya one, Miss!

111
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,580
How dare you guys do this to us?!

112
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,770
We're not gonna lose to you freaks!

113
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,990
The human slaves...

114
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,700
have started revolting!

115
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,090
This is the Border Police.  Is this the Minister of the Left?

116
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,600
Please pass this on to the entire kingdom!

117
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,370
The giant ship, Noah, has stopped moving upward,

118
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,630
and has started falling back onto Fishman Island!

119
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,210
What?!

120
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,630
The Noah's falling again.

121
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,660
Where are you now?!

122
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,550
In the Air Tank control tower!

123
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,340
Perfect!  Then you can
tell the entire country about this crisis!

124
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,280
None of the transmission stations in the country
are usable right now.

125
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,090
From where you are, you should be able to reach every state operated Snail Phone in the country!

126
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,990
Hurry!

127
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,160
Yes, Sir!

128
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,610
This is a transmission from the Air Tank above Fishman Island to everyone in the Kingdom!

129
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,100
Issuing emergency evacuation orders!

130
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,810
The giant ship, Noah, is falling toward the island again!

131
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,740
Evacuate the island immediately!

132
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,470
The bubble's gonna break!

133
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,820
The island will be crushed!

134
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,350
Leave it!  Don't worry about your possessions!

135
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,480
B-But!

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,690
Get into the ocean!  Everybody hurry!

137
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,740
No way!  It's coming back?!

138
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,080
Is Luffy okay up there?!

139
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,510
What happened to Princess Shirahoshi?!

140
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,680
Decken again?!  That insane pirate!

141
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,250
Let's run away too!  It's too dangerous here!

142
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,210
We'll take care of Hody and his men.

143
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,730
Those of you still watching,
get out of here and leave the island!

144
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,370
No!

145
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,630
What are you saying?!  It's particularly important that women and children get away!

146
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,910
Now, go!

147
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,870
The Straw Hat Pirates, a bunch of human outlaws,
are fighting to protect this island!

148
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,190
We can't just run away right before their eyes!

149
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,700
That's right!  We're the ones who asked them for help!

150
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,020
I can't do anything to help,
but I want to share their fate!

151
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,370
Me too!

152
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,580
And me, Right Minister!

153
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,300
Silence!

154
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,540
Listen, this is your duty!

155
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,460
Go!  You must pass on my words
to everyone else watching the battle!

156
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,820
Understood?!

157
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,270
Everyone here has to make up their own mind.

158
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,510
If you still want to stay, then suit yourselves!

159
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,020
Come at me, criminals!

160
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,240
Straw Hat Luffy-san. {Copy-paste from 562}

161
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,090
This is the Air Tank.

162
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,570
I'm the one you met earlier. {End copy-paste from 562}

163
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,720
Straw Hat?  What's with this broadcast?

164
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,640
We've been briefed on this terrible situation. {Resume copy-paste from 562}

165
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,600
Our sensors have detected the falling Noah.

166
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,600
Luffy-sama, whatever shall you do about the Noah? {End copy-paste from 562}

167
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,150
What are they doing?  Their transmission is being broadcast all over the country!

168
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,220
Shirahoshi... Straw Hat...

169
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,590
I wish we could do more,
but all we can do is entrust everything to you.{Resume copy-paste from 562}

170
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,230
Don't tell me how hard it is!
Just hurry up and give the air to me! {End copy-paste from 562}

171
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,630
That's Luffy's voice!  I'm so relieved!

172
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,460
What's up with this conversation?

173
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,680
I just heard the Princess's voice too!

174
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,590
Straw Hat... isn't he that notorious criminal?

175
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,800
The human?

176
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,300
Luffy-san, we leave Fishman Island to you! {EVEN MORE copy-paste from 562.}

177
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,350
Why is the Border Police relying on a human pirate?

178
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,220
Does he have some sort of plan?

179
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,780
A human's gonna stop the Noah?

180
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,950
Hey, Straw Hat. {I'm getting seriously tired of copy-paste from 562}

181
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,200
Can you hear me? {End copy-paste #9001}

182
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,380
Prince Fukaboshi...

183
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,590
Hody Jones... {This episode has no original dialogue in it -_-}

184
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,020
I understand him now. {End copy-paste #9002}

185
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,720
Bro-hoshi!  What do you mean, you understand him?!

186
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,990
Hody is...

187
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,720
a monster bred by his environment!

188
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,950
The New Fishman Pirates are nothing but monsters born of pure malice!

189
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,960
Their ancestors' hatred has been passed on
to them in the shadows of Fishman Island.

190
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,300
They fear that it might be forgotten.

191
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,620
They fear the day that
their grudge toward the humans fades away.

192
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,920
They live desperately...

193
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,600
and wish that humans will be evil,
just so their crusade will be justified!

194
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,280
These bloodthirsty monsters...

195
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,110
don't even want peace for Fishman Island!

196
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,350
What could have possibly happened to make you do this? {FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP IT WITH THE REPEATED DIALOGUE ALREADY!!!}

197
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,860
Answer me, Hody!

198
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,570
Just what did the humans do to you?!{End copy-paste #9003}

199
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,750
Nothing.

200
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,720
What?  Nothing?!

201
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,890
We must bestow judgment upon the humans.

202
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,580
We were chosen by the heavens...

203
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,660
and given the power to do so!

204
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,520
I see...

205
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,140
That explains it.

206
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,800
Their grudge...

207
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,810
has no personal experience or will behind it!

208
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,870
There's no substance to it.

209
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,940
They are a completely empty enemy!

210
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,900
Their grudge...

211
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,690
has no personal experience or will behind it!

212
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,380
There's no substance to it.
They are a completely empty enemy!

213
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,160
Empty?  What's Prince Fukaboshi trying to say?

214
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,550
Hey, you guys!
Don't just stand there!  Get off the island!

215
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,440
I can already see the Noah above the island!

216
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,130
Hurry, Weak-hoshi!

217
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,950
Hody-sama has become even more terrifying.

218
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,410
The creatures known as humans are inferior to us.

219
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,950
Don't forget that, Hody.

220
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,210
They are... vile beings.

221
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,670
It's hopeless!  We're done for!

222
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,130
Now that the Age of Pirates has begun...
our brethren are dying every day!

223
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,560
The humans are kidnapping young mermaids and selling them to the Human Shop!

224
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,660
The only thing left for us is death!  Fishman Island is done for!

225
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,040
Damn those humans!

226
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,070
Amazing!

227
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,220
This is incredible!  It's the birth of a hero!

228
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,430
Praise the hero who blew up the Human Shop
at the cost of his own life!

229
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,120
Serves you right, humans!

230
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,210
This is great!

231
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,230
Yeah.

232
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,490
Heroes are so cool -hi!

233
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,470
Dosun!

234
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,970
Arlong-san sunk another human pirate ship!

235
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,800
This is a holy war!

236
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,590
Since ancient days, that trash called humanity...

237
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,040
has been jealous of fishmen, who were chosen by the heavens and granted superior power.

238
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,380
They fear us!

239
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,710
And...

240
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,790
they've responded by persecuting us!

241
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,120
The humans infest this world like maggots...

242
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,710
and they used their only strength, the fact that they outnumber us,

243
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,400
to drive fishmankind to the bottom of the sea!

244
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,370
Listen up, everyone!

245
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,510
Curse the humans!

246
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,000
This human named Rayleigh,
who I've known since childhood...

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,810
He's a different kind of human.

248
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,060
He doesn't seem scared at all when he looks at me!

249
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,860
Nyuu- Hody?

250
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,100
I don't like your stories, Hachi-san.

251
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,380
You make me want to vomit!

252
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,700
The humans fear us!

253
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,110
Carry on our ancestors' grudge!

254
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,930
You got that, Hody?

255
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,420
Never forget, Hody!

256
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,390
They are vile.  They are an inferior race!

257
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,510
Curse the humans!

258
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,950
Curse them!  Curse them!  Curse them!

259
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,220
This is terrible!
Tiger-san, the hero who freed the slaves...

260
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,710
was killed by the humans!

261
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,060
What?!

262
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,010
This means that Tiger wasn't the chosen hero either.

263
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,210
Who are you?  Please, leave us alone!

264
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,530
We heard that you donated blood to a human.

265
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,030
So what?!

266
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,150
A human was about to die right in front of-

267
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,290
Daddy!

268
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,450
The Royal Family's insanity
has infected the entire country!

269
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,400
They want to forgive the humans!

270
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,580
Unbelievable!

271
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,520
Did you hear?
Jinbe-san joined the Seven Warlords of the Sea -hi!

272
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,620
The Arlong Pirates are the only ones maintaining the dignity of our race.

273
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,860
Otohime-sama's been shot!{Copy-paste from 546.}

274
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,140
See?!  This is what humans are!

275
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:26,740
Her Majesty was so generous toward the humans,
yet they showed her no mercy!

276
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,430
If the Royal Family won't take revenge and uphold their pride,

277
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,830
then we can't trust this country at all!

278
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,150
We don't need a weak country like that!

279
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,120
The one responsible for the shameless campaign was punished by the heavens!

280
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,500
It's only natural that villains
who want to forgive the humans end up dead -dosun!

281
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,130
The time for our revenge has come.

282
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,050
The heavens have finally chosen us,
and given us power!

283
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,670
Is this...

284
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,800
Those legendary goods -hi?!

285
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,520
I can't believe you got them -dosun!

286
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,310
Can you mass produce them, Zeo?

287
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,620
I'll give it a try.

288
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,490
The citizens of the Fishman District are fed up
with this country and will eventually band together.

289
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,810
This is a holy war.  Start preparing!

290
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,230
Prepare to kill the humans for as long as we live!

291
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,760
We were chosen...

292
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,980
to carry out the justice known as vengeance!

293
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,060
The day of judgment is coming.

294
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,480
Humans, you despicable inferior species.

295
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,120
We've chosen to give our lives
so that we may have our retribution!

296
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,700
We were too late!

297
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,800
I don't know when it happened, but those in
the Fishman District who didn't share our view...

298
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,970
have become an incarnation of fishmankind's negative emotions! { tlc: It's almost as if all of the dark emotions of Fishman Island split off and incarnated themselves as the Fishman District. }

299
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:32,970
As the outlaws gathered in the ocean's depths...

300
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,830
we just pretended that we didn't notice...

301
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,530
their distorted malice.

302
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,420
Hey, where are you going?!

303
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,230
Please let me go!  The Noah-

304
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,120
Don't be absurd!

305
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,450
We kept collecting signatures in Mother's place,

306
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,090
and only paid attention to the common citizenry.

307
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,250
That way, we thought we were making progress!

308
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,960
I know it must be difficult for you, {Copy-paste from 545}

309
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,160
but your anger and hatred toward the humans...

310
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,690
Do not pass it on to the children!{End copy-paste from 545}

311
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:07,600
We were too late!
They are the people that Mother feared the most!

312
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,220
Honorable brother.

313
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,360
We should have begun our fight...
in the outer reaches of our kingdom!

314
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,190
In the outer reaches, we should have fought...

315
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,870
against our species's loathing of the human race!

316
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,650
Mother...

317
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:31,390
Mother was killed by Fishman Island's malice!

318
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,780
She may have been aware of that fact.

319
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,760
Whoever the culprit is...{Copy-paste from 546}

320
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,830
please don't be angry for me.

321
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,900
Don't lose yourself in anger and hatred because of me.{End copy-paste from 546}

322
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:59,600
And yet, the voice of malice spoke
from somewhere in my heart, and I listened...

323
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,050
and resented the humans who killed Mother!

324
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,270
Prince.

325
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,970
The grudges of the dead must stay with the dead.

326
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:16,760
This malice is an illusion that
only the living create and nurture!

327
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,380
I couldn't fully abandon my grudge against
the humans, so I overlooked what was happening...

328
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,640
and allowed the malice
in the Fishman District to grow...

329
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,300
into a power so great that we couldn't stop it
when we did notice it!

330
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,180
At this rate, Fishman Island...

331
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,460
will destroy itself
because of a grudge against humankind!

332
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,890
Careful now.

333
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,210
This bubble can't protect the island, it has to envelope the ship!

334
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,700
We must hit the Noah!  If it misses, it'll be useless!

335
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,810
Straw Hat, I beg of you!

336
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,070
We don't need our past!

337
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,730
Please, give us a new beginning!

338
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,500
Please, destroy the ghosts from our past that keep this island away from the sun!

339
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,230
Alright... Now!

340
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,020
Go!

341
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,050
With your own hands, give Fishman Island...

342
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,940
a new beginning!

343
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,940
Enough of your nonsense, Fukaboshi!

344
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,100
Fishmankind's grudge will never fade!

345
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,330
Bro-hoshi.

346
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,930
If I get my way, you won't have to worry.

347
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,680
H-Hey... Aren't they the ones
fighting Hody's crew in Gyoncord Plaza?  {Swashy: timing issue at the end of this line}

348
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,560
Yeah, apparently it's the Straw Hat Pirates.

349
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,380
Boss Jinbe's with them too!

350
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,030
Huh?!

351
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,770
That's Luffy-chan's voice!

352
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,210
It's true!

353
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,000
Alright!  It's inside the air bubble!

354
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,410
We made the decision with Jinbe when we entered the plaza.

355
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,910
We won't let anyone harm Fishman Island!

356
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,710
You can leave it all to us, Bro-hoshi!

357
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,750
We're friends, ain't we?

358
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,040
How could we have doubted humans like these?

359
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,350
Hey, what's wrong?!  Don't stop!

360
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,340
We've got to get out of here!  Come on!

361
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,450
I'm... staying on the island.

362
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:30,980
What?!

363
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,580
Me too!

364
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,650
And me!

365
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,450
I won't run either!

366
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,040
Neither will I!

367
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,650
Luffy-sama, there's air on the Noah!

368
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,260
Great!

369
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,330
You can't escape from me!

370
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,130
Hody-sama is...

371
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,800
Weak-hoshi!

372
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,040
Stay close to me.

373
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,480
I won't let him hurt you!

374
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,060
A-Alright!

375
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,430
Straw Hat!

376
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,460
Luffy-sama!

377
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,740
Take this!

378
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,250
Ikaros's Fluttering!

379
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,840
Fluttering?!

380
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,120
That's not fluttering at all!

381
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,890
That's just spluttering!

382
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,110
Geso! { tlc: There's a missing line where Ikaros says "Geso!" here.  It's just a yell, but this particular yell is the name of a type of squid-leg sushi.  Of course, most of Icaros's yells/sayings/etc. have some relation to squid cuisine...}{ def: we could include a tl note here }{Starfish: Is this really even necessary to include at all? I mean, it's just a random exclamation that isn't even on-screen for one second, and I rather doubt the fans would go "OH MY GAWD WHAT DID IKAROS SAY THERE I AM SO CONFUSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111one" if we left it out either. And including a TL-note for a random exclamation that isn't even on-screen for one second strikes me as kind of... pointless.}

383
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,220
Ink?

384
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,170
Too bad for you -hi!

385
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,470
That was my Ink Clone!

386
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,500
Don't underestimate us command-

387
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,350
I'm gonna turn into grilled squid!

388
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,850
Alright!  It's General Franky's new finishing move!

389
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,160
He launched a fireball from his stomach!

390
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,680
It was you?!

391
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,550
Looking away?!  How disgraceful -gyaban!

392
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,300
You blocked my hammer with your bare hands?!

393
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,800
Ow... Maybe this wasn't the best transformation to fight a hammer.

394
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
Hey, Chopper!

395
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,870
Your human form has gotten pretty monstrous.

396
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:39,580
I'm alright.  I wanted to become human because I wanted friends.

397
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,380
Now I want to become a monster to help Luffy!

398
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,190
Is that so?

399
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,540
I wanna slice up those who laugh!

400
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,410
Show me why you're considered
the strongest swordsman on Fishman Island!

401
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,740
Right now, you can't even kill my boredom.

402
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,930
Straw Hat!

403
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,620
This is the end for you!

404
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,170
Weren't you listening?

405
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,580
I won't let anyone harm Fishman Island!
