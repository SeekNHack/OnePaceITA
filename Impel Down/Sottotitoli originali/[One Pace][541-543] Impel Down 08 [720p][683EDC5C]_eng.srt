1
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,640
Straw Hat, Ivankov and Inazuma all have Devil Fruit powers!

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
Don't forget to bring your prison bullets!

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,650
We've arrived at Level Six!

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,040
Charge!

5
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,210
What's this stone structure?

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,790
N-No way!

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,270
Are they still here?! Find them!

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,280
You seriously think anyone would open a hole like that and not run? Idiot.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,040
H-Head Jailer Shiryuu!

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,760
See that, you worms? When I'm not around, you can't do anything.{TLC}

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,320
You've been doing a pretty damn lousy job here.{TLC}

12
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,840
This is a horrible incident.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,480
A shame to Impel Down.

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,250
Those three guys you're looking for freed Crocodile and Jinbei...

15
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,210
before going up to Level Five through that hole.

16
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,800
Relay this message to Magellan at once: I'll lend him a hand.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,760
Well...

18
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,680
W-What?!

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,230
Crocodile and Jinbei?!

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,350
Yes! They're not in their cells!

21
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,710
S-So that means, even though I had them sealed up inside Level Six, they've managed to escape?!

22
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,330
There are five of them now, and they're all on Level Five?!

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,400
That's how it is!

24
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,820
Do you think I'm responsible for this?

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,620
Warden Magellan is handing over Portgas D. Ace right now, so you'll probably have to take full responsibility.

26
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,380
Full Responsibility?!

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,670
Right! I shall fight them as well!

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,590
Send all troops to Level Four!

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,800
Sadi-chan! Saldeath!

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,430
Take all your men with you and head for Level Four!

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,200
This will be an attempt to become Warden with your lives on the line!

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,510
Ah, I got it wrong! This will be a battle with your lives on the line!

33
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,890
Are vyou ready?

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,380
Even if vwe DO make it to the entrance on the first floor,

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,560
the problem is what comes after vwe've made it outside.

36
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,700
Vwe're surrounded by the impassable Calm Belt.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,320
If vwe're to cross it and reach Navy HQ, vwe have no choice but hijack one of the Navy's warships.

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,550
Numbers are absolutely essential!

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,760
Vwe have to get more allies.

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:49,220
The truth is, right now only a handful of vyou will make it to the first floor without getting caught!

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,200
If vwe are caught, gruesome torture awaits vus.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,580
So listen up, in order to increase vour survival rate just a little bit,

43
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,600
vwe'll have to free as many prisoners as vwe can between Level Five and Level One!

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,280
The more trouble the prisoners cause, the more enemy troops will be distracted by them!

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,730
Vwe will steal as many keys and free as many prisoners as we can while making our way up there!

46
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:17,250
Vwe are going to cause a riot here in Impel Down the likes of which has never been seen!

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,450
So let's go, Straw-Hat-boy!

48
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,510
Huh?

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,230
He's gone ahead already.

50
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,470
He freed himself?!

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,220
Vwe'll follow him immediately, Candies!

52
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,090
Wait! Will someone please stop me?!

53
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,180
So fast! So fast! I'm spinning even faster than ever!

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,670
The Tension Hormones were too effective!

55
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,310
Yeah. But that's actually pretty convenient, isn't it?

56
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,510
No, it isn't!

57
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,990
It's almost ten in the morning right now!

58
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,540
The execution will take place at three this afternoon!

59
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,210
They're certain to carry out the execution at that exact moment!

60
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,460
If Whitebeard intends to stop them, he should attack several hours before the execution!

61
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,500
Ace-san is already being taken across the sea.

62
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,510
The battle could break out any minute now!

63
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,220
They won't kill him before three o'clock, right?!

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,510
Then we still have a chance!

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,060
These doors are completely pointless.

66
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,860
I'll dry it up with my right hand.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,380
Explanation of Crocodile's Suna Suna Fruit powers.{for those just joining us...}

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,380
{\an8}Suna: Sand

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,540
He is a sand man who can turn into and manipulate sand.

70
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,600
The palm of his right hand can absorb the moisture from anything.

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,630
When touched by his hand, people and plants will dehydrate, while earth and stone will crumble to sand.

72
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
Here they are!

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
T-This is Level Four!

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,100
The prisoners that escaped from Level Six, the Warlord Jinbei...

75
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,860
Inferno Hell, huh?

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,060
The intruder, Monkey D. Luffy...

77
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,700
Hot!

78
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,360
The former Warlord, Crocodile...

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,680
They're all here!

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,000
Start counterattack!

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,290
Fire!

82
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,500
Morons! Use the prison bullets!

83
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,800
Crescent Sand Dune!

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,350
Shoot him! Use the prison-bullets!

85
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Gomu Gomu no...

86
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Rain!

87
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,780
Fishman Karate!

88
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,540
What?{Three... Years... Later...}

89
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
Arabesque Tile Fist!

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,490
T-There's no way we can win!

91
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,100
He's a rookie with a 300 million beli bounty, and he's got two Warlords with him!

92
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,340
D-Don't falter!

93
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,940
We'll just have to hold them back with our sheer numbers until the reinforcements arrive!{does it pay really well to be a prison guard?}

94
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,440
Move it. I'm in a hurry.

95
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,900
Let's go.

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,010
Damn them... Shoot!

97
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,880
Beast Hell

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,480
Hurry!

99
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,240
What is all that noise?

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,760
Camisole...

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,780
Long-johns...

102
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,450
All troops, proceed to Level Four.

103
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,540
All troops, proceed to Level Four.

104
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,290
I think I just heard something from the speakers...

105
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,190
Has something happened in the prison?

106
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,140
Hey, Buggy! Look!

107
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,080
The guards and the Blugori are leaving!

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,930
All troops, urgently proceed to Level Four.

109
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,640
Seems like there's some trouble on another floor, partner.

110
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,150
This is a great opportunity for us!

111
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,810
Yes, that's right...

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,370
When I think back on it...

113
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,390
We were chased by the Army-Wolves in Level Five...

114
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,700
And just moments ago, we were pressed against the floor trying to deceive those Accursed Beasts...

115
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:11,030
It might have seemed like comic relief, but we've FINALLY made it back here to Level Two...!

116
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,380
We're a breath closer to that long-awaited outside world...

117
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,720
Ya ready, guys?

118
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,870
Of course we are!

119
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,590
Fake keys that Three-guy made out of wax...

120
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,710
This is totally awesome!

121
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,420
All troops, proceed to Level Four.

122
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,420
Sector A! What's happening?!

123
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,340
Sector B, wait!

124
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,670
Assistant Warden! This is the monitoring room!

125
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,430
What is it?

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,980
This is strange...

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,090
Oh, no no... This cool hat, you see,

128
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,420
it is a specially-made headdress that I was going to wear to commemorate my promotion to Warden...

129
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,990
I'm not talking about the thing on your head!

130
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,990
I can see someone sneaking around on Level Two!

131
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,640
It looks like a couple of prisoners!

132
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,700
What?!

133
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,730
Oh, the keys! We're getting out of here!

134
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,130
Thanks a lot, you there!

135
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,450
C-Crocodile?!

136
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,190
I'm thinking of escaping this place, but I'll need some soldiers.{croc forever alone FeelsBadMan}

137
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,570
How 'bout it?{pls im desperate i know no one else}

138
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,600
Wanna join me...

139
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,060
Mister One?

140
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,560
I suppose I'll tag along, if it's with you.

141
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,760
I was starting to get bored.

142
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,260
Thanks a ton.

143
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,370
It's Captain Buggy you should be thanking.

144
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,160
Level Two guards, are you there?!

145
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,410
If you are, then respond!

146
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,640
Yes!

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,910
What are you guys doing?

148
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,060
Uh, we're heading to Level Four, like we were ordered...

149
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,670
No! Stay and keep watch on that floor!

150
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,220
This floor?

151
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,070
Things have turned to our favor, partner!

152
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,000
If these guys start rioting again, we can use that chance to smuggle ourselves onto a warship!

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,930
Indeed, and then our escape will be complete!

154
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,130
I suppose Straw-Hat and Mister Two are already dead...

155
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,260
Even if they survived, they'll be stuck in prison for the rest of their lives!

156
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,910
Our own lives are the most important thing!

157
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,550
So long, suckers!

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
That's Buggy the Clown!

159
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,490
Up there! Look above you!

160
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,920
Above us...?

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,550
Well then, men!

162
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,700
This is the best chance we'll ever get!

163
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,170
If ya wanna taste the fresh air again, raise hell like your lives depend on it!

164
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,070
That's the kick-off!

165
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,060
Our savior!

166
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,930
That's Captain Buggy!

167
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,720
T-This is Level Two...

168
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,730
The prisoners have escaped from their cages and are running wild again!

169
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,730
Please send the Blugori back here!

170
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,440
We can't restrain them!

171
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,280
This is Level Four!

172
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,180
What is it now?!

173
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,460
The Okama-queen Ivankov, Inazuma,

174
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,000
and the guy you ran into earlier, Mister Two...!

175
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,650
Quit messing around!

176
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,100
They've arrived, followed by a huge crowd of people!

177
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
A... A crowd?!

178
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,560
All troops, urgently proceed to Level Four.

179
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,720
All troops, urgently proceed to Level Four.

180
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,990
And the people they've brought with them are... You won't believe this!

181
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,970
They're prisoners who have vanished over the years,
who we thought had been taken by the Demon's Tug!

182
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,360
What did you say?!

183
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,690
What's going on here?!

184
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,120
Vwe've finally made it!

185
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,960
Straw-chan!

186
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,170
Bon-chan!

187
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,080
You got a tension boost, huh?

188
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,980
I'm unstoppable now!

189
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,310
Why are you here, Mister One?!

190
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,610
Who's this guy?

191
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,940
He's the guy who was beaten by
Waistband-chan back in Alabasta!

192
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,480
Oh? Someone I don't know, then.

193
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,480
Assistant Warden! Hurry and send reinforcements to Level Four!

194
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,670
Level Two, as well!

195
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,910
What do I do...?

196
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,320
Emporio Face-Growth Hormone!

197
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,090
It's too hot!

198
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,200
Hell Wink!

199
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,700
It's no use!

200
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,980
We can't stop them!

201
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,140
All these prisoners, who were really ferocious before they disappeared,{now they're ferocious and fabulous!}

202
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,040
are all wearing some kinda weird, fanatical getups!

203
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,050
They're unstoppable in more ways than one!

204
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,800
Let's go to Navy HQ!

205
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:33,440
It seems like an unprecedented riot is taking place in Impel Down.

206
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,660
Their leader is Monkey D. Luffy.

207
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,770
Take a good look at the sky. It's the last time you'll see it.{this dude looks pickled}

208
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,320
Once you've been secured on to the execution platform,

209
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,790
you'll never...

210
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,630
see the sky again.

211
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,240
This is Onigumo.

212
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,060
Prepare to open the gates to Marineford.

213
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,130
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

214
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,450
How did it go?

215
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,810
He's nowhere to be found!

216
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,830
There's just over 5 hours left till Ace's execution.

217
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,200
We have no idea when Whitebeard might show up,

218
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,980
and now, even though we've entered the most critical time,

219
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,230
we can't find the Warlord Blackbeard anywhere on the island, no matter how hard we look!

220
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,850
And one more thing...

221
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,240
A warship that didn't get clearance to leave...

222
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,510
just arrived at Impel Down!

223
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,820
What?!

224
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,420
You don't suppose...

225
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,600
Please, wait here!

226
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,780
We didn't call for any outside reinforcements,

227
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,990
and we're in a state of emergency and cannot take on this responsibility!

228
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,530
We were just checking with HQ...

229
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,350
Who cares about that? We're on the same side, ain't we?

230
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,730
S-Still! Pirates aren't allowed inside the prison, regardless of the circumstances!

231
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,050
No need to hold back.

232
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm with the Government!

233
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,060
What a depressing place this is!

234
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,210
Reporting in!

235
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,330
The crew of the ship that Blackbeard arrived on...

236
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,800
has been eliminated!

237
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
What?!

238
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,990
Hey!

239
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,680
Sir!

240
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,850
Wait, you lot!

241
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,000
Liberation!

242
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,460
We've got an intruder!

243
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,380
He's one of the Seven Warlords, Marshall D. Teach!

244
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,420
Hey! Hang in there!

245
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,270
These guys are the guards that were just wiped out!

246
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,030
Darkness...!

247
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,770
Blackbeard and his crew have broken in with hostile intent, no doubt about it!

248
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,060
I was... pulled into the darkness...!

249
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,690
We don't know what they're here for!

250
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,690
It's over! My life is over!

251
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,020
No, that's not true.

252
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,540
This is the beginning.

253
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,120
This is the beginning of my dark, depressing life where I'm unable to become Warden.

254
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,580
Assistant Warden!

255
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,790
Pull yourself together!

256
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,150
Straw Hat Luffy is on Level Four,{kae: great gods, guys, make sure this says straw-hat, not monky d}

257
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,160
Buggy the Clown is on Level Two,

258
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,130
and the Warlord, Blackbeard, is at the main entrance!

259
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,470
What can I do about this?!

260
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,220
How about going back to the monitoring room and eating some crackers?

261
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,520
Pull yourself together! We must protect Impel Down!

262
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,060
Sure, you're not the one taking responsibility here, so of course you can say that...

263
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,490
Don't tell me you're trying to take my job as Assistant Warden?!

264
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,490
Hannyabal!

265
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,950
Can you hear me?

266
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,770
W-Warden Magellan, is that you?

267
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,790
Where... Where are you now?

268
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,080
I'm in Level Two.

269
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,200
I've taken care of the imbeciles who were causing an uproar here.

270
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,510
What?

271
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,300
Help...!

272
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,220
I've sealed all the exits to this floor.

273
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,930
They'll be completely immobilized before long.

274
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,890
We're trapped here!

275
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,380
Captain Buggy! There's a clog of poison blocking the way!

276
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,630
Damn you, Magellan! You sneaky bastard!

277
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,450
We'll be in big trouble at this rate!

278
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,430
I have no idea why Blackbeard has invaded this place,

279
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,250
but I have a plan to deal with him.

280
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,590
It's a risky move, but as things stand now, we have no choice.

281
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,810
A risky move, is it?

282
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,010
I hoped it wouldn't come to this, but I've decided that we must release Shiryuu!

283
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,890
Seriously ?!

284
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:18,120
In any case, we can't rely on
reinforcements from Navy HQ.

285
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,730
We must pull through on our own, one way or another.

286
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,740
Send all available troops to deal with the situation on Level Four.

287
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,660
I will be on Level Four shortly.

288
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,780
Hold tight until I get there!

289
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,320
Warden!

290
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,880
Warden!

291
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,650
Yay! Warden!

292
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,320
Let's just hurry up and get moving.

293
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,640
Impel Down Head Jailer

294
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,640
Shiryuu of the Rain

295
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,520
Shiryuu. Does it feel good being out of that cell?

296
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,230
Yeah, I've learned my lesson.

297
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,900
I was about to die from eternal boredom...

298
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,710
You're not just gonna use me then lock me up again, are you Magellan?

299
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,810
You've been sentenced to death.

300
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,810
This is an opportunity to postpone your sentence.

301
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,520
There is no second chance.

302
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,390
Yeah, I see.

303
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,770
I'll keep that in mind.

304
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,270
Your sword, Head Jailer Shiryuu.

305
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,440
I'll leave Blackbeard to you.

306
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,300
Very well.

307
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,330
My sword, eh?

308
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,270
Long time, no see...

309
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,880
So sorry...

310
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,890
For cutting you guys down.

311
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,480
All the guards have been defeated!

312
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,810
They've stolen the keys!

313
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:20,200
Now, keep building vour numbers, and let vus throw the prison into chaos!

314
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,240
This way, the enemy can't hold vus back, and vwe'll increase vour chance of survival!

315
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,240
If you wanna escape, get out of those cells!

316
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
This is your chance to escape!

317
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,790
Let's go together!

318
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,130
You're letting us out of here?

319
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,930
Go, Blugori!

320
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,460
Go wild!

321
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,100
Damn, it's the Blugori!

322
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,000
Head Guard Saldeath, we're counting on you!

323
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,940
Blugori! Get that Okama with the humongous face!

324
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,530
It's not a huge face! It's vmy Face-Growth Hormones!

325
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,520
Get him, Blugori!

326
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
Hell...

327
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,560
Wink!

328
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,110
He took out the Blugori army with one hit!

329
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,210
I-Impossible!

330
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,880
I don't get it! What is that?!

331
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,890
Straw-Hat-boy!

332
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,500
Vyou don't have time to be standing around!

333
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,330
Leave vyour back to vus, and just keep running forward and climbing upward!

334
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,210
Get going!

335
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,810
Right, gotcha.

336
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,140
Thanks!

337
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,550
It's the Demon Guards!

338
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,690
There's three of them!

339
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,580
Alright, it's reinforcements!

340
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,150
Sadi-chan and her team are here!

341
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,440
These kids won't...

342
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,870
let you take a single step past this spot!

343
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,930
Luffy-kun, let us go! I will help you!

344
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,280
Though I am not so good at fighting on land...

345
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,500
Really? You're pretty tough...

346
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,910
Get them, Demon Guards!

347
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,020
Take this!

348
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,180
Without its eyesight, even a Demon Guard
is useless as a tree stump.

349
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,220
Get them!

350
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,630
We'll crush them!

351
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,010
Everyone attack at once!

352
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,910
Pathetic weaklings...

353
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,540
No use! They're too strong!

354
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,490
Neither guns nor cannons affect them!

355
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,420
Help!

356
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,280
It's hopeless! Don't fight 'em! Pull back!

357
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,440
We're all gonna die!

358
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,950
These guys are worse than the Blugori! Run!

359
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,340
Oh, I just love the sound of your screams!

360
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,880
Those Demon Guards are quite frightening, indeed!

361
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,290
Help us!

362
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,220
Gear Third!

363
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,700
Fishman Karate!

364
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,850
Get them, Demon Guards!

365
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,500
Gomu Gomu no...

366
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,140
Gigant...

367
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,810
Five Thousand Tiles...

368
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,740
Sables!

369
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,860
Fist!

370
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,140
Pistol!

371
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,020
Raise the drawbridge!

372
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,510
Don't let them through!

373
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,750
{\an8}Hurry!

374
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,890
Underwater Prison Impel Down

375
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,890
Crimson Hell

376
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,850
{\an8}There's only five of 'em! Stop Blackbeard's crew!

377
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,070
Fire! Fire!

378
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,090
He might be a member of the Warlords, but he's intentionally betraying us!

379
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,170
Blackbeard is no longer our ally!

380
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,300
So what if he betrayed us? He was a pirate to begin with.

381
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,640
H-Head Jailer Shiryuu!

382
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,060
When did you get out of the cell?

383
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,110
Five enemies, eh?

384
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,020
Who's that?

385
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,520
This guy looks dangerous...

386
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,090
Is that Magellan?

387
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,760
You're Marshall D. Teach... "Blackbeard", are you not?

388
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,030
Yeah, that's right! And who're you?

389
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,080
It's no use!

390
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,060
They beat the Demon Guards! We can't stop them!

391
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,600
Charge forward!

392
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,410
There's nothing to be afraid of!

393
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,920
Damn! Their numbers keep growing!

394
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,310
Damn-!

395
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,730
That's the leader of the Demon Guards, Sadi!

396
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,700
Who cares?! Get her!

397
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,310
Silence! You will refer to me as Sadi-chan!

398
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,740
Violence of Arousal...

399
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,200
Red Demon Whip!

400
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,000
How dare you...

401
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,330
do such a thing to my adorable...

402
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,170
minions?!

403
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,350
Damn her!

404
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,670
Wait.

405
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,870
Didn't Vi tell vyou to keep moving forward?!

406
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,440
Emporio Female Hormone!

407
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,310
Make way, eccentric girl!

408
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,130
Silence! You're a female Ivankov, huh?

409
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,320
You ambiguous anarchist!

410
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,120
Right now...

411
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,730
Vi feel like a woman.

412
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,720
Hurry! The staircase to Level Three is close!

413
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,230
I will open the door!

414
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,030
Right, let's go!

415
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,430
What? The door is opening itself!

416
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,630
Who cares? We're in luck!

417
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,430
Now let's go to Level Three!

418
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,960
This is the fortress of Hell!

419
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,500
You shall not pass!

420
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,360
Who is this guy... Barging in here like he's so big?

421
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,930
Hannyabal! He's the Assistant Warden of this prison!

422
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,970
Fire!

423
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,980
Behold!

424
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,520
I've got a thousand men guarding the stairs to Level Three,

425
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,950
all wielding bazookas loaded with special prison ammunition!

426
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,920
There's no escape for you!

427
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,640
To defend the bright future of the defenseless civilians...

428
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,850
Straw Hat, infamous, world-renowned pirate...

429
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,110
I will carry out your sentence on the Warden's behalf!

430
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,570
His attitude is different from what we're used to...

431
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,450
Move it!

432
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,220
No way!

433
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,040
He's serious!

434
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,020
Then we can count on him! He's really strong!

435
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:53,200
Hannya! Hannya!

436
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,350
W-What?

437
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,760
You know it!

438
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,110
The Hannya Carnival!

439
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,900
Inferno Hell Carriage!

440
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,950
If you're not gonna move, then I'll send you flying!

441
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,350
I will save Ace!

442
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,560
Don't make me laugh!

443
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,630
If you could send me flying so easily, I wouldn't be worthy of being Assistant Warden!

444
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,800
Gear Second!

445
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,140
Gomu Gomu no...

446
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,240
Jet...

447
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,420
Gatling!

448
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,240
We've been waiting for you...

449
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,300
Warden Magellan! Please hurry!

450
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,190
Where are the ones leading the riot?

451
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,150
They're right in front of the stairs to Level Three.

452
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,740
The stairs leading from floor to floor are pretty far apart. Let's hurry!

453
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,860
We're just barely managing to hold them back with the help of Assistant Warden Hannyabal!

454
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,770
Assistant Warden!

455
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,690
Let go of me!

456
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,610
I will not...

457
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:10,040
LET YOU PASS !

458
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,100
Follow the Assistant Warden's lead! Keep fighting!

459
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,520
FINE BY US!

460
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,850
That was nothing! I can still fight!

461
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,940
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

462
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,530
I-I will not let you pass!

463
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,920
Gomu Gomu no...

464
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,640
Jet Stamp!

465
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,380
Wait!

466
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,060
Don't get in my way!

467
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,690
Damn! I have to hurry, or Ace will...!

468
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,160
What do you mean, you're gonna save your brother?!

469
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,470
Don't try to glorify the trash of society!

470
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,550
You pirates and rebels gained your reputations outside by committing crimes!

471
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,710
Assistant Warden Hannyabal!

472
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,730
Just stay down! You'll die!

473
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,430
Civilians can't sleep at night...

474
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,380
fearing that their loved ones will lose their lives, and it's all because you scum dare to sail the seas!

475
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,020
And that is why we imprison the most dangerous criminals around the world...

476
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,150
To make sure that the defenseless civilians can rest easy!

477
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,820
This is the fortress of Hell!

478
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,120
If it were to fall, the whole world would descend into the depths of fear!

479
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,400
I said I wouldn't let you pass, so
you're not taking a single step past me!

480
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,620
Assistant Warden...!

481
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,010
Ace is important to me! So move it!

482
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,990
I can't reason with such a fool...

483
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,740
A-Assistant Warden! Help us!

484
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,240
H-Hey! What happened to you?!

485
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,250
Just give it up!

486
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,330
Don't go around spouting that crap about "Justice" or "Evil"!

487
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,800
You can look all over the world,

488
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,190
but you'll never find an answer!

489
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,800
Ridiculous!

490
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,400
He's that guy I met in Jaya!

491
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,300
Well, this sure is quite an impressive group.

492
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,010
We've walked in on a pretty major incident, huh?

493
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,100
Teach! What are you doing here?!

494
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,020
Or I suppose I should call you Blackbeard now?

495
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,130
Jinbei...

496
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,410
Hey, hey, no need to be so violent. Mind loosening that fist of yours?

497
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,770
Oh yeah, I heard you and Ace were good friends, huh?

498
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,990
But I'm not the one you should be blaming here.

499
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,290
Blackbeard?!

500
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm chasing after a certain man.

501
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,050
He calls himself Blackbeard.

502
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,750
People's dreams...

503
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,300
will never end!!

504
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,220
I heard that a pirate called Blackbeard...

505
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,850
managed to join the Warlords by capturing Fire Fist Ace.

506
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,650
Blackbeard...

507
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,730
So you're...

508
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,910
So you're...

509
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,880
Blackbeard?!

510
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,920
Huh? Oh, yeah, I never introduced myself, did I?

511
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,710
Long time no see, Straw Hat!

512
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:15,350
I sure was surprised when I heard that you were Commander Ace's little brother!

513
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,830
Shouldn't you be there?

514
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,600
They're gonna start soon, ya know?

515
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,560
Your brother's execution, that is!
