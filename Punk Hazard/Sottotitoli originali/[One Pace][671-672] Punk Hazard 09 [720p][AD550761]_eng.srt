1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,070
{\an8}Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,720
{\an8}Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,270
{\an8}So many obstacles are already behind us!

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,680
{\an8}Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,660
{\an8}"I'm almost there, just a little further and I'll have the answer."

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:38,370
{\an8}That's what I believed as I sailed into this new world.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,860
{\an8}That's right, the pieces of our dreams are joined together as one.

8
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:53,920
{\an8}We're connected by unwavering bonds, let's head for a bright future!

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,550
{\an8}Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

10
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,420
{\an8}Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,780
{\an8}So many obstacles are already behind us!

12
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,800
{\an8}Now let's keep moving forward!

13
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,300
{\an8}Always look up!

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,480
{\an8}Keep your head held high!

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,940
{\an8}Always step up!

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,820
{\an8}Fly over the waves!

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,410
{\an8}Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,650
{\an8}Now let's head for the future!

19
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:31,060
{\an8}We drift forward, riding the waves,

20
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,290
{\an8}meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

21
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,530
{\an8}all under this flag...

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,640
{\an8}Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,180
{\an8}There was a day when I softly carved it there.

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,810
{\an8}I won't let anyone take my freedom.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,750
{\an8}I grasp it tightly in my hands!

26
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,690
{\an8}Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,370
{\an8}Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

28
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,660
{\an8}So many obstacles are already behind us!

29
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,830
{\an8}Now let's keep moving forward!

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
{\an8}Always look up!

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,530
{\an8}Keep your head held high!

32
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,900
{\an8}Always step up!

33
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,720
{\an8}Fly over the waves!

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,430
{\an8}Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,970
{\an8}Now let's head for the future!

36
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,010
Punk Hazard Island   Central Lake

37
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,010
‒ Zoro's Group ‒

38
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,820
I wonder, could that be a Slime?

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,050
Slime?

40
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,720
Indeed.  I have read about them in books.

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,350
That thing looks exactly like the monsters called Slimes
that appeared in those books.

42
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,750
I was fascinated by what I read!

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,650
The monsters called Slimes tend to attack women...

44
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,930
and their body fluids melt the women's clothes!
Truly indecent monsters!

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,030
Who would make up
such a ridiculously convenient monster?!

46
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,500
C-C-Could you lend me that book later?

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,540
And me!

48
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,720
Hey idiots, take a good look.

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
Pinky swear!

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,050
I dunno if it melts your clothes or whatever, but touching it is probably bad.

51
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,840
The fish are dying because of
the body fluids that have fallen into the lake.

52
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,230
Those things are clusters of poison.

53
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,440
This whole lake will become toxic if we wait too long.

54
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,140
Toxic?

55
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,340
Then what will happen to Samurai-san's torso?

56
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,300
Don't tell me... you're going after it, Sanji-san?!

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Of course I'm going!
Blood will be on my hands if I don't!

58
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,250
As a man, this is something I must do!

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,880
Sanji-san!

60
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,610
Just do something about the Slimes around us.

61
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,480
What?  Around us...

62
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,790
Slimelings!  When did they surround us?!

63
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,390
Forgive me, Nami-san.
I'm the best swimmer we've got.

64
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,170
I will return
before any harm befalls your beautiful body!

65
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,160
Please, take care!

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,340
Th-This is colder than freezing!

67
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,100
Where is that torso?!

68
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,320
Monet is the only one here.

69
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,530
This is my chance.

70
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,530
If you're looking for Master, he's not here.

71
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,840
I see.  Where is he?

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,250
Who knows.  He's pretty twisted,
so he's probably watching the battle outside.

73
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,000
I've found everything
that I'm going to find on this island...

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,310
so I'm planning to leave soon.

75
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,770
I see.  It'll be lonely without you.

76
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,050
First, your ability could be helpful for a small task.

77
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,570
Mind coming with me?

78
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,710
Oh, a date?  How lovely.

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,530
Unsocial as ever, I see.

80
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,390
What is it?

81
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,880
You'll see once we get there.

82
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,380
Fair enough.  I was bored anyway.

83
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,210
Is that the bird-lady Usopp was talking about?

84
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,040
Caesar's Lab   Main entrance

85
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,040
‒ Luffy's Group ‒

86
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,030
S-Straw Hat's got Master!

87
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,990
Nice going, Luffy!

88
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,000
Damn that bastard!

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,330
Straw Hat!

90
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,000
Let go of me, you filth!

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,570
No way!

92
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,750
So that's Haki, huh?

93
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,920
Luffy is one hell of a guy!

94
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,550
He's holding onto a Logia user.

95
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,890
Straw Hat!  Get away from Master!

96
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,800
We've gotta save Master!

97
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm your opponent!

98
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,750
Clutch!

99
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,970
Get outta my way!

100
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,060
With Luffy as strong as he is now,
that guy should be a piece of cake!

101
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,170
We can't be sure, just yet.

102
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:23,560
The Color of Arms Haki can restrain Logia users, who would normally be untouchable,

103
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,350
but it can't take away their power
the way ocean-energy or Sea Stone can.

104
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,040
We still don't know the true power...

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,820
of the Gas Gas Fruit.

106
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,290
Don't get cocky!

107
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,110
Color of Armaments: Hardening!

108
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,840
Rubber...

109
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,430
Bell!

110
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,110
Gas Robe!

111
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,470
What's this?!

112
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,110
It's wrapping around me!  I can't get it off!

113
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,270
How long can you hold your breath?

114
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,940
Just inhale it already, and die!

115
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,830
Luffy!

116
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,610
Damn it all!

117
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,950
I've performed experiment after experiment
in order to heighten the deadliness of my gas.

118
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,670
Has he lost his mind?!

119
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,660
He's intentionally breathing in Master's poisonous gas!

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,130
He inhaled it all!

121
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,250
He's dead!

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,540
I guess poison doesn't affect me much anymore.

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,020
Must be because of Magellan.

124
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,260
Magellan?!

125
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,740
The poison-man of Impel Down?

126
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,640
Don't you dare compare me to that Paramecia-user!

127
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,320
Rubber...

128
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,750
Jet Mace!

129
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,010
Master!

130
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,010
That bastard!  What did he do to our Master?!

131
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,560
Do not interfere, trash!

132
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,310
T-Trash?!

133
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,630
Did he just call us... trash?!

134
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,670
You must have heard it wrong!

135
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,410
Rubber...

136
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,740
Bring it!

137
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,120
Gatling!

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,160
Gastanet!

139
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,110
Luffy!

140
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,560
That's our Master!

141
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,190
Now, time to finish you off.

142
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,310
Awaken, Smileys!

143
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
Smileys?

144
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,090
What?!  They're starting to move!

145
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,490
Smileys, stick yourselves to Straw Hat!

146
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,030
Jump!

147
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,660
Why are these things listening to Master?!

148
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,630
Luffy, be careful!  They're gonna explode!

149
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,130
Luffy!

150
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,180
Blow him to pieces!

151
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,700
Gastanet!

152
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,060
Luffy!

153
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,520
Rubber...

154
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,240
Jet Stamp!

155
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,310
M-Master!

156
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,840
That was one huge explosion!

157
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,870
He escaped from the explosion!  That guy sure is fast!

158
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,310
Thank goodness.

159
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,150
S-Straw Hat just...

160
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,680
Is he immortal?!

161
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,730
Alright!

162
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,360
How dare you hurt our Master?!

163
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,900
Get outta my way!

164
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,460
Alright, this time I've got you!

165
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,010
Master!

166
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,750
Robin!  Franky!  You got anything to keep this guy in?

167
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,180
He's a Logia-user, so tying him up won't work.

168
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,040
Hmmm, is there a barrel or something lying around?

169
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,460
Hey, hold it, Straw Hat!

170
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,300
The Navy's G-5 unit will take him into custody.
And you too!

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,280
Prepare yourselves!

172
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,530
Smoker-san!  Straw Hat's group have got Caesar!

173
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,230
Straw Hat?

174
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,640
Luffy?

175
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,550
You really underestimated me.

176
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,620
Inside the Laboratory

177
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,620
‒ Law's Group ‒

178
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,060
Law?

179
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,870
Who's there?!

180
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,330
What's wrong?

181
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,730
It looks like you're in pain.

182
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,430
Who's... there?!

183
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,310
It's me.

184
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,360
What... are you...

185
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,940
doing here?!

186
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,760
How many years has it been?

187
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,900
You've grown, Law.

188
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,570
Did you honestly think
he didn't know what you were up to?

189
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,640
We do not trust Caesar.

190
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,820
That is why he went to great lengths to infiltrate Caesar's operations...

191
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,310
using Monet.

192
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,160
I hear you're one of
the Seven Warlords of the Sea now.

193
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,730
How mighty you've become.

194
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,600
When did you get here...

195
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,640
Vergo?!

196
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,220
I just arrived.

197
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,100
I happened to be in Dressrosa...

198
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,630
and an S.A.D. tanker was heading here, so I got on it.

199
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,560
Looks like I made the right choice.

200
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,950
What do you mean by that?!

201
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,950
Have I ever harmed you?!

202
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,400
If any harm had been done to us, you would already be dead.

203
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,860
But if you try to keep secrets from adults, you will inevitably be caught, Law.

204
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,810
Then... I'll just have to...

205
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,270
get rid of you!

206
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,040
Oh, and there's one other thing.

207
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,000
You misspoke.

208
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,770
It's Vergo-san.

209
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,410
In Front of the Laboratory - Luffy's Group

210
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,350
What just happened?

211
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,210
I have no idea.

212
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,740
What should we do?!

213
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,740
Tashigi-chan!

214
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,250
That's Vice-Admiral Smoker!

215
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,440
I never thought I'd see the day
when he was beaten unconscious twice!

216
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,050
The three Straw Hats were all beaten too!

217
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,490
Could it have been the Haki of Conquerors?

218
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,960
No way!  There couldn't possibly be
that big a gap in their power!

219
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,500
Then what was it?!
He took them all out without lifting a finger!

220
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,160
Serves you right, Navy!

221
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,380
That's the true power of our god of salvation, Master!

222
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:21,710
Master!  Master!  Master!

223
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,590
My mighty soldiers!

224
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,190
Put all five of them in chains!

225
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,930
Use Sea Stone on the Devil Fruit users!

226
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,120
You can leave the marine grunts where they are,
and follow me inside the laboratory.

227
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,340
It's dangerous here.

228
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,760
Strange creatures seem to be raining down on us,
but do not worry!

229
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,450
I will make sure our place remains safe!

230
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,490
Yes, Master!

231
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,200
The Cool Brothers seem to have failed me.

232
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,370
Well, there's no helping that.

233
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,400
Fighting Straw Hat and Law
must have been too much for them.

234
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,530
Central Lake - Zoro's Group

235
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,190
I've had enough of this!

236
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,480
I-I-It's poison gas!

237
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,320
My eyes!  My eyes!

238
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,070
Wait!  I had no eyes in the first place!

239
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,980
Why would you do that?!

240
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,090
You're just some freak with jelly for a body!

241
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,740
More poison gas!

242
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,440
What should we do, Zoro-san?!  It spews poison gas!

243
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,330
I just did that, didn't I?!
Try to learn from others, skeleton!

244
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,620
I thought maybe you just had bad luck.

245
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,750
I know!  The enemy is jelly!

246
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,400
You should eat and digest them.

247
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,110
No way!

248
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,200
Stop bullying me like that!

249
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,110
I am at least seventy years older than you!

250
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,660
Sorry... Grampa.

251
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,300
Sorry... Grampa.

252
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,830
Who are you calling Grampa?!

253
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,200
I am still a fit young skel-

254
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,580
What's wrong?!

255
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,740
It's so cold!  Sorry, Nami-san.

256
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,760
Could that be...

257
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,750
the Slime's toxin?!

258
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,240
Come on, now!

259
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
I hope that the samurai's torso
hasn't been consumed by the toxins!

260
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,760
I've been using
the Color of Perception for a while now, and yet...

261
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,110
He must be quite weak.

262
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,830
His life-signs are getting mixed with the fish,
so I can't tell where he is!

263
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,180
A shark?!

264
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,680
Hey, are you kidding me?!

265
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,520
A-Are you alright?

266
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,100
Hey, what is it?  What's going on?!

267
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,430
Hold it right there, damn fish!

268
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,910
Don't eat him, shark!

269
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,960
I-It hurts not!  It merely itches!

270
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,020
What the hell?

271
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,870
He's obviously in pain.

272
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,450
It hurts... not!

273
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,010
What if something has happened to Sanji-san?!

274
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,890
Let go of him, damn you!

275
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,570
Now!

276
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,040
Joue Shot!

277
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,040
{\an8}Joue: Cheek

278
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,960
Alright!  The final piece is safe!

279
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,110
With this, the samurai puzzle is completed!

280
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,340
I've gotta hurry and get back...

281
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,320
before the path is gone!

282
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,190
Damn it!

283
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,880
Has the poison spread this much?!

284
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,400
This is bad!  I've been cut off without realizing it!

285
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,660
Can Nami-san's muscles do what I need them to?

286
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,730
This will cause her trouble later, but...

287
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,890
This is bad!

288
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,580
The poison has
almost completely spread through the lake!

289
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,260
Sanji-san, hurry!

290
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,630
Blue Walk!

291
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,240
Don't close!  Don't close!  Don't close!

292
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,060
Sanji-san!

293
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,180
Look at that, he got him!

294
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,570
He really did!

295
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,610
What can I say?

296
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,540
Never before have I been so happy
just to have the body I was born with!

297
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,020
Samurai from the Wano Kingdom

298
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,020
Foxfire Kin'emon

299
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,240
Oh my!  Samurai-san, you certainly are big!

300
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,190
You're as tall as me!

301
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,460
I just realized, I have not introduced myself properly!

302
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,090
My name is Kin'emon!

303
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,610
I was born in Kuri, Wano Kingdom!

304
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,060
H-H-Hurry it up!

305
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,990
I'm gonna die here!

306
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,280
Very well!  I am most sorry.

307
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,950
Transform!

308
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,130
I'm still cold...

309
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,550
That coat will disappear if he takes it off, right?

310
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,610
Man with the eyebrows,
will you give me your name in return?

311
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,310
I'm Sanji!

312
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,810
And what do you mean by this?!

313
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,120
Just because you've got your body back,
you suddenly want a polite introduction festival?!

314
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,080
You took full advantage when you were helpless...

315
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,530
and spouted countless cheeky rude comments at me!
You haven't forgotten, have you?!

316
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,600
You people are pirates?!{Copy-paste from 582}

317
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,380
That explains your savagery!

318
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,680
I loathe pirates.  They make me vomit! {End copy-paste from 582}

319
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,060
You're such an annoying bastard! {Copy-paste from 585}

320
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,110
Just ask us!  Say "Please search for my body"!

321
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,480
I refuse to be indebted to a pirate! 
 I would sooner die than ask for your help!

322
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,680
Alas, I would be defenseless if you left me here,
but if you want to take me with you...

323
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,350
I would not complain.{End copy-paste from 585}

324
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,480
I have not forgotten!

325
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,100
I will never...

326
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,410
forget what you've done for me!

327
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,160
For as long as I live!

328
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,420
I can never repay this debt!

329
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,410
Also, I never stopped doubting you until you gave me my torso back.

330
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,080
Please, forgive me for that!

331
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,760
I beg of you!  I beg of you!

332
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,550
Cut it out, idiot!  Raise your head!

333
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,980
A man shouldn't bow so easily!

334
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,360
But... if you had not shown up, I would never have...

335
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,110
Uh, I hate to interrupt, but... Sanji-san...

336
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,960
We do appear to be in the middle of a hopeless crisis.

337
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,730
Look.  See?

338
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,030
There's nowhere left to run!

339
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,900
Hey, you guys!
Didn't I tell you to take care of these things?!

340
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,760
We tried but nothing worked.  Not our fault.

341
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,430
Exactly.

342
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,280
Don't be so lax, idiots!

343
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,460
I can't let Nami-san's body be hurt!

344
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,450
This body...

345
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,210
This body absolutely must not...

346
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,330
You don't want to give it back, do you?

347
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,130
Of course I don't.

348
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,430
Shall we try igniting them?

349
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,320
Foxfire Kin'emon is my name.

350
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,390
My blade is one that scorches its enemies.

351
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,810
I shall make that creature combust, and thus open a passage for us!

352
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,650
Scorches its enemies?  That sounds like magic!

353
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,300
He... cut the flames!

354
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,130
The way is open.

355
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,090
I am coming for you now, Momonosuke!

356
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,770
What the?!  We're unharmed!

357
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,270
I'm sure that we were
just engulfed by the flames of that explosion!

358
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,050
K-K-Kin'emon-san... What just happened?

359
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,150
I merely cut the explosion in pieces.

360
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,060
You cut it?!

361
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,590
My Foxfire Style scorches enemies with flames,

362
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,930
and furthermore,
one of its special techniques is to cut flames apart.

363
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,710
There is no fire I cannot cut!

364
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,580
Now then, I shall head for the laboratory to rescue Momonosuke.

365
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,430
Please excuse me!

366
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,400
Hold it!

367
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,290
Your samurai fighting style has caught my interest.

368
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,240
I'll help you save your son.
