Let's pile up all the dreams,

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,390
And go find the thing we're looking for... One Piece!

00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,690

And pretend that it isn't there!

Let's pile up all the dreams,

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,690
and go find the thing we're looking for...

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,940
A pocket of coins, and

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,050
We are!

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,630
Let's break the tight-fisted night!

21
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,170
We have no interest in treasure chests

22
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,640
A pocket of romance, and

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,580
We are!

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,600
Let's pile up all the dreams,

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,260
And go find the thing we're looking for...

26
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,300
A pocket of coins, and

27
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,640
We are!

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,180
We are!

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,860
We are!

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:38,200
{\an5}Brook's Past!
The Rumbar Pirates and Laboon!

31
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,930
Alright, close it.

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,690
Are you sure? What about Perona?

33
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,450
We looked, but we couldn't find her, so there's nothing we can do.

34
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,620
Okay, it's fine now. Invisibility off!

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,900
A magnificent escape, fosfos!

36
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,310
Damn, but my knees were shaking back there...

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,450
I don't understand what "Tyrant Kuma" was doing on Thriller Bark...

38
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,920
Well, you see, Absalom...

39
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,120
Tyrant Kuma came to deliver the news about the successor of the former Warlord Crocodile. {Sewil: changed from "Tyrant Kuma came to deliver the news about the former Warlord, Crocodile's successor."}

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,830
His successor?

41
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,610
But that wasn't the most important part.

42
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,300
Apparently, it's a guy called Blackbeard,

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,360
but what's really scary is what the guy's pulled off!

44
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,380
Read this.

45
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,910
The commander of the Second Division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Fire Fist Ace...

46
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,540
...has been captured and taken to the great prison, Impel Down?!

47
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,490
Ace... he's famed as one of Whitebeard's best men...

48
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,720
The government's gotten themselves an incredible card...

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,810
Indeed...

50
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,990
They could easily try to use this to bring about the end of the Age of Pirates...

51
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:53,170
In this kind of situation, there's no time for Moriah-sama to just lie here!

52
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,710
Well, I understand what you're trying to say...

53
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,130
But I just...

54
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,360
Want a bride...

55
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,910
Right. Just get me a corpse that's your type.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,870
Not a zombie! I want a real, living woman!

57
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,560
{\an8}Man, I guess we ended up all sleeping a whole day right out there in the courtyard...

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,990
{\an8}Well, ya know, we did stay up that whole night fighting!

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,440
The day after Moriah's defeat

60
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,830
{\an8}I'm hungry, Sanji!

61
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,440
{\an8}Go eat some cheese or something!

62
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,350
Cheese isn't good enough! I can't run on cheese!

63
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,280
Well, why don't you take the cooking stuff over to the courtyard?

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,460
The Victims' Association guys don't want to leave the place,

65
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,150
so we're all gonna eat over there.

66
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,980
Sorry about that! Everybody's so happy to finally be in the sun after all these years...

67
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,780
They're all just lying there sunbathing!

68
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,770
But, how can you be in such a good shape anyway?

69
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,450
It's totally strange. It's a mystery!

70
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,470
Do you have enough ingredients?

71
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,870
We got back what was stolen from us...

72
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,170
What's more, we even got a mountain of extra food, so we're fine.

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,740
But who brought that, I wonder... I guess there are some kind people here too.

74
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,580
They even brought all the treasure here...

75
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,660
Even if this was Christmas, this really is too much!

76
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,890
I'm so happy...

77
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,480
Wow, a glass bracelet!

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,950
Oh, this is cool! I'll take it!

79
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,550
Hey, hey, you can't just go around taking it like that, you know... R-Right, Nami-san...?

80
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,130
It's fine. If it's just that one, it's not even all that valuable.

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,700
So that's how it is...?

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,880
However! I'm not giving you a single bit of it!

83
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,310
We're not gonna steal anything from the ship of our saviors, you know, Namizou.

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,870
Ahh! What a cool knife!

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,160
What did you just say?!

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,320
Oh, I'm sorry! Oh, but it's got jewels in it...

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,520
Huh? I just spoke without thinking... Who's Namizou?

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,540
Come to think of it, isn't it odd?

89
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,420
It kinda feels like I've seen you before somewhere...

90
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,810
Could it be...

91
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,430
Lola?!

92
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,270
That's right... Did I even tell you my name?

93
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,480
So it was you, Lola?!

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,030
I'm so glad I got to see you again!

95
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,730
Lola, you mean...

96
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,540
Whoa, hey! Wait a second!

97
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,280
Could she really be that boar-zombie?!

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,750
You don't remember, huh? I'll tell you all about it later!

99
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,120
Anyway...

100
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,180
I'll give you this! As a sign of my gratitude!

101
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,360
Huh? Is that alright? To me?!

102
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,100
Nami is giving treasure away!

103
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,410
I'm going on ahead, you think this will be enough?

104
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,030
A storm is coming!

105
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,250
Huh, a storm? Seriously?

106
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,270
Ah, this is bliss...

107
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,980
The light is... Hitting me, and...

108
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,890
We're still alive...

109
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,600
We are...

110
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,860
Hey!

111
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,350
Huh?

112
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,180
We've brought food!

113
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,220
Straw Hat!

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,020
You should have asked us, we would've carried it!

115
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,170
We can't have our saviours working like this!

116
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,500
Is Zoro awake yet?

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,730
He's still sleeping like a log... He's in the mansion.

118
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, wake up!

119
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,360
Chopper!

120
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,010
We've brought the stuff you asked for!

121
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,730
Oh, thanks!

122
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,210
How is he?

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,390
This is the first time Zoro's been this badly injured...

124
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,020
He was really close to dying...

125
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,680
I just know it... Something must have happened to him...

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,890
While we were unconscious...

127
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,530
Indeed. It's hard to believe that that man would just leave like that.

128
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,330
It's also weird that Luffy is so energetic all of a sudden, isn't it?

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,380
I have no idea how that happened either!

130
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,370
What happened, huh?

131
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,060
Actually, I saw it all!

132
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,510
I saw all of it, too!

133
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,910
We'll tell you!

134
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,640
It's about what happened back then! {Halee: Added "It's" at the beginning of the sentence so that it doesn't sound too weird when connected to the previous one.}

135
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,190
Come. {Sewil: changed from "Hey." as he says "koi" not "oi"}

136
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
Sanji?

137
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,680
Wait, why? You were pretty cool too, you know!

138
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,520
"Take my life instead of the swordsman's", you know?

139
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,610
Shut up! Hurry up and tell me.

140
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,040
What happened afterwards?

141
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,450
After I fainted, I mean.

142
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,100
Well, that Warlord had another crazy power, you see!

143
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,500
He just put his paw on Straw Hat,

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,140
and repelled all of the damage that had been inflicted on him!

145
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,220
Damage...?

146
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,870
Like a huge ball of agony!

147
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,860
Just touching a tiny bit of it, that swordsman screamed in pain!

148
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,030
Sorry, but I seriously thought that swordsman was gonna die.

149
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,020
So, we actually cried!

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,290
We cried a lot!

151
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,750
I see... Then, that's why Luffy is in perfect shape, while Zoro ended up like that...

152
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,260
How reckless...

153
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,200
Nothing... happened...

154
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,880
All right! We've gotta tell the rest of the crew this beautiful tale-

155
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,260
Wait! Don't you go running your mouths off with that stuff!

156
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,490
He didn't risk his life so that we'd praise him about it.

157
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,800
And besides...

158
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
How do you think Luffy would feel if he knew all that pain he took on himself had gone and hurt his friend?!

159
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,670
Just don't say anything!

160
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,840
As long as everyone is safe, that's all that matters.

161
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,270
Well, I'm gonna go eat.

162
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,950
T-T-T-

163
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,610
They're super cool!

164
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,310
What a lucky captain!

165
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,020
I see.

166
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,160
Hey, you two.

167
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,330
You said you knew something earlier, right?
What did you see?

168
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,970
Don't go askin' us that stuff.

169
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,240
Everyone's safe... that's all that matters.

170
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,930
I... I want to say it!

171
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,250
T-The beautiful tale of what a man had to endure!

172
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,770
W-What?

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,290
Let's eat!

174
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,640
So good!

175
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,360
I've never eaten anything so good!

176
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,600
We haven't eaten a proper meal in years! {Sewil: changed "for years" to "in years"}

177
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm so happy to be alive!

178
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,660
I've made plenty!
Don't go leaving leftovers, you hear?!

179
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,690
I am so glad I got to eat your food again, Cook-san!

180
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,970
It is so good, I could continue until my stomach burst!

181
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,500
Even though I do not have a stomach!

182
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,640
You! Shut up and eat!

183
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,820
What a funny skeleton!

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,960
Indeed, ah, excuse me.

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,730
Being able to eat to my heart's content yesterday, and again today... I think...

186
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,190
I might be getting fat!

187
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,200
"Even if I'm just bones!", right?! Shut up, you!

188
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,480
Skeleton, you're the best!

189
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,900
Hey, how can you move, anyway?

190
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,580
Oh, who cares?

191
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,860
We didn't even toast, but it turned into a party anyway, huh?

192
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,900
He's not waking up even with this much noise... {Halee: Was "Even if it's this noisy, he's still not waking up..."}

193
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,800
Even though he's usually the toughest one here...

194
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,220
Hey, Chopper! This...

195
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,450
Luffy!

196
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,800
...is Zoro's share!

197
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,860
Now, drink up!

198
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,870
Don't make him drink that!

199
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,710
What's with you?! Zoro likes this stuff, so it should make him better, right?!

200
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,080
What kind of medicine is that?!

201
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
I can't?

202
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,020
Then, how about meat?

203
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,390
Okay, okay! Thanks for the sentiment, that's enough!

204
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,240
Just the sentiment, okay?

205
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,330
There was a piano in this room?

206
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,190
Hey, weren't you a violinist?

207
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,120
I can play any instrument you like!

208
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,850
I see... You're pretty good.

209
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,530
Um, about that conversation earlier...

210
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,490
The truth is, I saw it all, too.

211
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,990
I was deeply touched by what the two of you did.

212
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,860
It sure is nice to have friends, isn't it?

213
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,670
Don't bother saying "the two of you"... I just ended up looking like an idiot.

214
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,260
No, you were just as prepared as he was.

215
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,670
Is there any song you'd like to hear?

216
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,940
If you have a request...

217
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,880
Huh? Anything goes?

218
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,080
Then, how about...?

219
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,290
{\an8}Yo-hohoho, Yohohohoo,

220
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,420
What happened to asking for requests?

221
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,460
{\an8}Yo-hohoho, Yohohohoo,

222
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,920
{\an8}Going to deliver Binks' Sake!

223
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,700
"Binks' Sake"... I think I know this song from somewhere... It's very nostalgic...

224
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,320
{\an8}Following the sea breeze! Riding on the waves!

225
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,990
Hey, Brook! I know this song!
Shanks and his crew used to sing it.

226
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,090
Back in the old days, every pirate would sing this song.

227
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,900
Through hard times, and fun times...

228
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,270
Say, you're gonna come with us... right?

229
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,610
You got your shadow back, right?

230
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,960
So even though the sun rises, you can still travel, can't you?

231
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,390
Speaking of that... there is one thing I did not tell you...

232
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,180
What?

233
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,550
I have... a promise I made with a friend.

234
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,140
First, I have to fulfill that promise.

235
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,030
Otherwise... I could not call myself a man.

236
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:18,250
Yeah... Laboon, right? I know. Franky told me.

237
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,470
Is that so? Laboon...

238
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,510
That is indeed the name of that whale...

239
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,860
He is waiting for me at that cape...

240
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,770
Like I was trying to say, Brook...

241
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,380
We met Laboon at the twin capes! It's true!

242
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,730
I already know that Laboon has been waiting for his friends to return there for fifty years now.

243
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,910
Hey, skeleton! What's wrong?

244
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,300
You're not playing the piano as quickly anymore!

245
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,010
It was a real surprise...

246
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,500
We never thought that the last surviving one of the pirates he was waiting for...

247
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,460
Would actually turn out to be you!

248
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,620
And... You still remember the promise, too!

249
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,080
Once he finds out, I'm sure Laboon will be really happy!

250
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,260
Wait... Wait a minute, please.

251
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,140
What a surprise!

252
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,230
Out of the blue... are you telling me you really... met Laboon?!

253
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,770
Yeah!

254
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,310
Even after fifty years has passed?!

255
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,050
Laboon is still waiting at that cape, even now?!

256
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,700
Is that true?!

257
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,360
Yeah!

258
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,880
We can vouch for it too! We really met him.

259
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,060
Yeah.

260
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,400
How was he doing?

261
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,790
He was doing great!

262
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,170
He was big as a mountain.

263
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,510
That I must see... back when we left him behind, you know...

264
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,420
He was still only the size of a small boat... He was rather cute...

265
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,860
He could be a little difficult sometimes,

266
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,570
but he loved music... he was a good kid...

267
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,840
Even now... If I close my eyes, I can see his face...

268
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,870
He is still there...

269
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,550
So, that's how it is...?

270
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,430
So, he is still fine?

271
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,080
I have never been so happy before...

272
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,380
What's with this whale? He's following the ship...

273
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,720
Must've got separated from his herd, huh...? Poor little thing... The ocean's a big place...

274
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,020
He looks so sad... And he's still just a kid, isn't he?

275
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,630
Well then, Captain Yorki... Shall we sing a song?

276
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,750
Brook! Great idea!

277
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,910
Hey, everyone, get your instruments!

278
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,960
We can bring a smile to even a crying child's face!

279
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,440
Let's show him what the Rumbar Pirates can do!

280
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,480
Okay!

281
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,460
One, two, three, four!

282
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,630
Rumbar Pirates
Musician, swordsman

283
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,510
{\an8}Hi, good day, everyone! It's morning!

284
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,850
Brook
(50 years ago, 38 years old)

285
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,580
Let us start singing our morning song!

286
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,460
And the power-tune we will be bringing you this week is...

287
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,740
That famous song,
"Black Handkerchief of Happiness"!

288
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,350
Everyone, feel free to join in!

289
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,570
Oh, white handkerchief

290
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,180
Don't let him find you!

291
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,610
Run away

292
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,160
Oh, white handkerchief

293
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,580
Don't let the octopus get you!

294
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,190
Watch out for the ink! Look, there's a squid as well! That's the ink again!

295
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,040
{\an8}P-Please stop making that noise so early in the morning!

296
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,620
{\an8}We're getting up! We're getting up, Brook!

297
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,060
Oh, white handkerchief

298
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,170
{\an8}Ugh, we're awake! We're awake!

299
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,230
It's the all inked Black Handkerchief of Happiness

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
Hey, Brook! Try playing that song as a ballad!

301
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,900
Understood! The captain's favorite song!

302
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,690
It's the whale!

303
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,330
Hey... you're that little guy from yesterday...

304
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,580
You still hanging around? Go look for your pod!

305
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,330
So cute!

306
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,660
Hey, how long is he going to keep following us?

307
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,740
I'm sure his mom is worried!

308
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,020
Here, have some food, Laboon!

309
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,530
Whoa, whoa, since when does the thing have a name?

310
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,450
We're under attack!

311
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,860
Are you alright?!

312
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,090
Help us! This guy has got a damaged leg!

313
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,420
Captain! An injured man fell into the sea!

314
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,300
Just throw out the life buoy!
We'll have to help him afterwards!

315
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,350
I suppose that is all I can do, seeing how I can not swim...

316
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,020
You saved us, Laboon!

317
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,980
Hey! We're fine!

318
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,610
Oh, Laboon!

319
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,590
Alright, everyone sing! We're singing "that song"!

320
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,620
You must be freezing, right?

321
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,580
Treasure! We found it, Laboon!

322
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,440
We're gonna have a real feast today!

323
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,280
We did it!

324
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,750
A sea monster appeared!

325
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,420
Protect Laboon!

326
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah!

327
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,360
He likes you most, doesn't he, Brook?

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,240
After all, Laboon loves music.

329
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,960
Nah, it's probably because your heads have the same shape!

330
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,540
Ah, I see.

331
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,360
You... can't you do anything about it?

332
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,780
We've all tried telling him, but...

333
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,850
He won't listen to us, it seems.

334
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,140
You understand, right?

335
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,490
I don't think we're strong enough to protect him if we take him any further...

336
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,310
He's just a kid.

337
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,460
We can't take him with us to the Grand Line.

338
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,250
Please listen to what I have to...

339
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,500
No, the song will have to wait.

340
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,300
We certainly are comrades, but you are just a whale...

341
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,380
The Grand Line is a dangerous sea! Really!

342
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,010
Listen, you're a big kid now...

343
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,950
but there are beasts out there like nothing we've ever seen here in West Blue...

344
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,530
Laboon, listen to...

345
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,180
No use. He refuses to listen.

346
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,850
It didn't work, huh?

347
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,790
Then how about a song first?
Let's sing that song.

348
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,180
That would only make it worse, I think...

349
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,880
This is no good... I know it's hard,
but we've gotta turn our backs on him, okay?

350
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,850
Until Laboon leaves the ship, we're not gonna sing or play any music.

351
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,830
We'll be thrown overboard at this rate, captain!

352
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,610
Look at that! That's our guidelight, pointing to the entrance of the Grand Line!

353
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,550
Can anyone see Laboon?!

354
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,750
No, we haven't seen him for a week!

355
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,830
I feel sorry for him, but this was for the best.

356
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,800
If he's lucky, he might be able to return to his family.

357
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,460
Men, are you prepared?!

358
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,830
Yeah! We're ready!

359
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,710
Then let's go! To the world's largest ocean!

360
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,500
Yeah!

361
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,420
I'm the lighthouse-keeper, Crocus. Good job making it over Reverse Mountain.

362
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,920
{\an8}Welcome to the Pirate Graveyard.

363
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,290
Grand Line Entrance
Twin Capes

364
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,290
{\an8}Hey, hey, this isn't some kind of show, you know!

365
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,630
Back in West Blue, I'm known as "Calico Yorki".

366
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,600
Sorry to bother you, Crocus-san, but...
Well, our ship got pretty damn beat up back there...

367
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,380
You may stay as long as you wish, but I'll ask you
to help with the food and drinks while you're here.

368
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,510
Man, you're something! Sponging off pirates, huh?

369
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,290
Sure, sounds fair. Why don't you join us in our celebrations?

370
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,280
Today, we're all gonna throw a huge party!

371
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,160
By the way, that whale that came with you, is that your pet?

372
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,310
Laboon!

373
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,410
Brook!

374
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,240
Hey, Brook! Let's sing that song!

375
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,080
Captain, you really love that song, don't you?

376
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,310
Yeah! It's the song of pirates!
Laboon! You love that song too, right?

377
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,880
Yohohoho, yohohoho

378
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,230
Yohohoho, yohohoho

379
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,500
Going to deliver Binks' sake

380
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,840
{\an8}Following the sea breeze, riding on the waves

381
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,970
Crocus-san. Do you have a request?

382
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,910
{\an8}Far across the salty deeps, the merry evening sun

383
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,390
Anything goes, huh, Brook?

384
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,000
Pirates love singing!

385
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,380
{\an8}Painting circles in the sky, birds singing along

386
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,690
{\an8}Farewell to the harbour, to my old hometown

387
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,860
{\an8}Let's all sing out with a DON, as the ship sets sail

388
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,090
3 months later

389
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,240
Please understand.

390
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,470
Laboon! Wait for us! Our ship is gonna sail straight ahead, and cross this sea.

391
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:09,080
It might sound strange, but we'll end up on the other side of the Red Line again...

392
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,910
And then we'll climb this wall once again, and return to this cape!

393
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,360
You just wait for that!
It should take about two or three years,

394
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,720
and after that, you'll see us all again!

395
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,880
When that time comes, you should have grown big and strong!

396
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,320
See you later, Laboon! Stay well!

397
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,970
Laboon! When that time comes, no matter where we go, you can come with us on our adventures again!

398
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,240
We're comrades, after all!

399
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,240
Laboon! We'll definitely travel around the world, and come back here!

400
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,190
Wait for us!

401
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,240
Three years later

402
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,860
The Florian Triangle

403
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,610
Hey, Brook! Your techniques are incredible!
Can you also teach me how to use a sword?

404
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,520
A tornado?! But it was clear and sunny just a minute ago!

405
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,360
Anyway, let's run! Common sense won't work on this sea!

406
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,770
Man... now that we're actually here, this place really is unpredictable... Can we really hold up?

407
00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:00,680
Ah, but hey, a rough day just makes the sake at the end taste all the sweeter! Ain't that right, Brook?

408
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,190
Play a tune for us again, today! Play that song!

409
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,940
I knew you would say that! Well then, here I go!

410
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah! Do it, do it!

411
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
The mirror...

412
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,500
I see... So, I have become a skeleton...

413
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,680
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

414
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,760
Owowowowowow! That hurts, Captain!

415
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,340
Why am I getting punished too?!

416
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,940
Shut up! Stop fighting about such stupid things!

417
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,800
But Captain, this guy nearly killed me with a stray bullet in that battle back there!

418
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,000
But you're still alive, right? He's already apologized as well!

419
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,330
Stop fighting about stuff that's already in the past! It's pathetic!

420
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,540
That hurts!

421
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,140
That pain proves that you're alive!

422
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,710
That's right!

423
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:02,920
Stars... This vast, starry sky... I wonder if Laboon is looking at it as well...

424
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,480
What do you think, Captain?

425
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,660
Hey, everyone, come and see this! Brook's being sentimental!

426
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,100
P-Please stop! That is embarrassing!

427
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,500
They're from the Navy Headquarters! What should we do?!

428
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,080
Don't be scared! Get them!

429
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,750
Wow, look! The captain's bounty just went up again!

430
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,640
How's that?!

431
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,450
Let us sing a song!

432
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:39,590
Yorki~! Yorki~! May his name echo all the way back to Twin Capes!

433
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,220
Terrible news! Hey, it's the captain! There's something wrong with Captain Yorki!

434
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,790
An infectious disease?!

435
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,380
Yeah...

436
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,800
Nobody go into the room... There are ten others infected besides the Captain...

437
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,530
He may have got it in that jungle we passed through...

438
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,240
It's an undiscovered virus... I'm afraid there's nothing I can do!

439
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,960
This is a terrible situation...

440
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,810
If things go badly, it could kill this entire crew!

441
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,340
Captain... Captain Yorki...

442
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,630
Don't sound so damn depressed...

443
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,260
You'll ruin the good name of the Rumbar Pirates, who can make a crying child laugh.

444
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,230
I'll just be... leaving the Grand Line a little ahead of you guys...

445
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,220
You guys just leave this old ship with us and the virus...

446
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,210
You should... find yourselves a new ship, and keep on going!

447
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,940
Captain...

448
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:16,900
We'll do what we can... and see if we can somehow make it out of the Grand Line through the Calm Belt...

449
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,560
Well, it'll work out somehow. Sorry, you guys...

450
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,820
Give Laboon my best regards!

451
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,040
Wipe those looks off your faces, guys, and stand up straight!

452
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,080
Yes!

453
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,720
Brook...

454
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,790
Yes.

455
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,410
I can't take it...!

456
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,470
Captain Yorki... I will never forget those words!!

457
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:02,870
All right, Captain?! I have engraved them into my heart! Please... take good care of yourself... Captain!!

458
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:09,070
I shall be leaving this ship... But please... Live, and let us all meet again!

459
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,330
Just take off this mask!

460
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,850
Let us all sing together again...!

461
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,460
Hey, Brook...

462
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:34,130
Send me off with... My favorite song...

463
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,780
Going to deliver Binks' Sake...
